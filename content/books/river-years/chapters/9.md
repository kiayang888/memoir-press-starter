Summary: Rice planting with too few hands; Grandma’s brief absence; word of my mother’s mistreatment; fetching baby Nomfue, feeding him back to life.

Chapter Narrative: In May, Uncle Lisfoom led us to prepare a rice field with the cousins down by the Nabmub River. Grandma, overcome by grief, went to stay with her relatives in Nabhiab for about a month. Planting time arrived. We boys were in school, so only Aunt Mab and Aunt Mos stayed to plant with the cousins. When the cousins finished and left, the two of them remained alone in the wide plain. Nights were long and frightening, but they kept working until the field was done.

The monsoon began, and word reached us that my mother was being mistreated by my stepfather. She went ua nkauj fa to Uncle Kaub Vue (Uncle Vam Meej Vwj) in Long Cheng and sent a message to Grandma to come take Nomfue. He had rashes, and people said he had drunk gasoline because my mother could no longer focus on life. The stepfather didn’t want her to raise him.

It was around August 1973 when Grandma brought Nomfue home. He was almost a year old but as small as a six-month-old, thin and covered in rashes—no nutrition like children have today. We ran to him, comforted him. Grandma chewed rice and fed him like a bird, and we all did the same. He cried at night, hungry and missing his mother, but the rashes faded and he grew. Grandma assigned Jua—only seven or eight years old—to care for him at night. I took care of Xeng Doua. We always did things together, taking the little ones wherever we could—except when the work was too far or too heavy to carry them.

Family is the circle that catches the falling child. When the world closed in, Grandma opened her hands—and we learned how love can nurse a baby back to life.
