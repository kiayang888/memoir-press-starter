Chapter Narrative

The monsoon set in—rain every day, sometimes all day—and the rivers swelled. At Nab Pas, the water ran high and hard. We arrived late morning and figured how to cross. The two Thai guides were strong swimmers. They cut thick hmab luam thoos (wild vines) and swam them across, tying them to trees. We built a bamboo raft, fixed it to the vine, and ferried people three or four at a time: pulled from one bank, received at the other. It took all day to get everyone across. We camped on the far side—finally safer; from here the route was wilder, with fewer patrols. The next day we followed the river again. I even caught fish along the bank as we walked. Near evening I helped uncle Lisfoom gather lumber and banana leaves to make two tsev pheebsuab for our family of twelve. Often three of us slept under one ntaub kaus ntsuab (green tarp/leaf cover).

At a safe spot we practiced inflating our swim tubes—bright, round, like children’s pool rings—and learned how to float with them. Everyone had fun except Yeeb. Water never loved him. With the tube at his waist, his head dipped under and I had to flip him upright. He nearly drowned twice in later years, even in America.

We spent the night there and walked on at dawn, following the Dej Xeev. Wild elephants were plentiful. We used their trails for days but stayed alert—not to meet them, nor they us. I can’t say how many days and nights to the Mekong—perhaps fifteen.

By late morning we reached the valley that climbs Roob Phajtsum. We started up—rock, cliff, slides of loose stone. We were twelve, with most of you only six to ten years old, and Voos barely two and a half. By sunset we had climbed half and stopped. Some men still had strength and threw together a small shelter—plenty of bamboo and kuj yem around.

That night, most families ran out of rice. Ours did too—no breakfast for morning, nothing for the day to come. This is where I saw the Lord’s mercy. Of twelve, only txiv Lisfoom, me, aunt Mos, Grandma, aunt Iab, and niam ntxawm Lisfoom carried rice for the whole trip. Grandma’s silver weighed about 25 pounds; niam ntxawm Lisfoom carried Voos and could not carry much else. The other five children carried nothing. Yet our rice lasted—enough—until the others’ ran out.

Morning came different than any other—no food at all. We climbed for two hours and reached the top. We passed pines and broad, flat stones laid like steps. We came to a cliff that overlooked the Mekong and Thailand—before noon. They told us it was only three hours down. We waited for darkness.

Those with guns shot monkeys and cooked them. We had none. We watched and starved.

At sunset we started down. At the bottom it was pitch black—you couldn’t see the person ahead. I held Xeng Doua’s hand; someone held his; someone held Nomfue’s. We crossed a wet rice field, then a highway, and soon the bank of the Mekong River.

It was after midnight. People gathered in clumps, waiting for boats.
