Chapter Narrative

We clambered up the bank, soaked and shaking, to a field beside the river. I can’t recall what kind of crop it was. There was a small cabin, and everyone drifted toward it. Phauj Chaiv Tawb and several families were already there; they were the ones who had been on the same boat we’d clung to.

The sun was up. A Thai village sat not far from the field, and the Thai men—both our helpers and the robbers—had told the village head that refugees were coming. Villagers brought us their leftover rice from the night before. There wasn’t much—each person received only about an inch in the bowl—but it was warmth and mercy. The nai npab (village headman) then led us into the village. There, I even saw one of the Thai men who had traveled with us all the way from Kiaj Mus Nas.

Around noon they loaded us into a cargo truck and drove us to Npooskas.

We arrived in early afternoon—one or two o’clock—and they dropped us at a government building on the Mekong riverfront, directly across from Pajxas, Laos. It must have been a Friday; there was some kind of celebration. I remember someone saying a few Hmong men from Ban Vinai had come. They shared what was left from the party—mostly fruit.

I ate some pineapple and promptly passed out. When I woke, the sun was gone. I found myself under a tree beside the road, looking out over the sandy edge of the Mekong.

That evening some “White men” arrived with a pickup full of rice sacks and unloaded them for us—but we had no pot to cook with.

Night fell. Most people lay on the grass behind the government building. We three brothers squeezed into one of the tsev xalas (open pavilions).
