Chapter Narrative

When we regrouped at zos Tiaj Nyom (village), some of our relatives stayed with us there. We sent word to yawg Txhiaj Nchai—father of txiv A and txiv Npuag Xyooj Thoj—who was in zos Thasxes near Roob Xam Liaj. He asked permission to visit and help get us out from the soldiers’ control. Soon after, we moved to zos Kiaj Mus Nas (Vam Leej Zos), where hlob Vam Teev had been living.

As the monsoon waned and the rice fields neared harvest, we settled at Roob Suab, between zos Pham Hiab, Moos Oo, and Kiaj Mus Nas. We waited there for about a month. During that time, we helped niam tais Paj Tsab Xyooj (Grandma’s older sister—the mother of niam dablaug Xaiv Neeb Muas) carry their rice from the fields to their house. We worked all day, and they thanked us with ib kawm—one woven basket—of rice.

Not long after, the government allowed us to move in with hlob Vam Teev and yawg Tshuas Ntaj at their village. We settled with hlob Vam Teev.

When we first surrendered and returned to zos Tiaj Nyom, our old home, uncle Tswv Nploog, tijlaug Ntsuab Pov, and another uncle hid in the woods at the village’s edge. We brought them lunch and dinner almost every day. Once, because it was raining, they were too tired to return to the woods and hid in the guest bed, covered with cloth. Soldiers arrived without warning, but—by God’s mercy—did not find them.

Another time, niamtij Ntsuab Pov, Maiv Zeb, and I went to zos Dej Taug to weed rice. Tijlaug Ntsuab Pov and uncle Tswv Nploog joined us and stayed the night. At dawn we headed for the fields early, trying to avoid detection, but enemy soldiers were already on the road and stopped us. They asked where we were going so early. We said we were going to catch fish first and then work in the fields. We led them to the abandoned house where we had slept, answered questions for about an hour, and then the soldiers moved on. We returned to the rice fields and worked.

Soon after, tijlaug Ntsuab Pov and uncle Tswv Nploog slipped away to Thailand with another group. Word came back that they would return to guide us out as well.

During New Year 1978–1979, Grandma and I visited zos Tiaj Nyuj Qus to see uncle Lisfoom, dablaug Xaiv Neeb, and my mother. We told uncle Lisfoom about the plan to go to Thailand. He and uncle Xaiv Neeb followed us back, but when they saw how far our place was from the escape route, they went to zos Thasxes and built houses with other relatives on an open plain—this became zos Tiaj Qhib.

Many relatives who moved there were preparing to flee. They laid out new rice fields right at the beginning of the route toward Thailand, not far from Roob Xam Leej.

At that time, I was the oldest boy. Grandma purchased a tiny old house across the creek from hlob Vam Teev’s home. We took it apart, carried the lumber, and rebuilt it on the ridge between hlob Vam Teev’s house and yawg Txhiaj Xeeb’s house. It was the smallest house we had ever lived in.

Late 1978, I had to work for the government. Once, I carried a 105 mm shell head up to the camp at Hav Naj Lab. Twice, I went to zos Xam Noom Uab to harvest rice left behind by our Hmong Cobfab (soldiers). The first time, yawg Txhiaj Xeeb and I reached the village and stayed the night, but we heard the Cobfab wanted to “visit” in the morning, so we left. The second time, we harvested successfully and filled a rice barn. I later carried some of that rice back to zos Moos Oo.

Our family owed much to yawg Txhiaj Xeeb’s household, especially yawg and txiv Nyiaj Pov. They led Grandma and me in preparing both opium and rice fields, and we shared their field cabins because our plots were right beside theirs.

By May 1979, the rice was just sprouting, and the fields were turning green. We obtained permission to stay at the fields overnight. Toward late afternoon, I took the goats and two horses, and all you younger ones—except phauj Mos—stayed with Grandma. We set off for uncle Lisfoom’s village, left the animals with niam hlob Npliaj Npis, and continued to our second rice field, the one nearest the start of our escape route.
