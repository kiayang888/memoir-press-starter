Summary

This chapter marks a quiet, powerful turn in your story — a moment of survival, faith, and the invisible strength that carried you through hunger and loneliness. It shows not only the hardship but also the spiritual awakening that came from endurance.

Chapter Narrative

The rice fields ripened, and we harvested what we could. We carried the bundles home and stored them in the barn—txhab—hoping they would last through the season. But the rats found them first.

They ate through the walls, through the bags, through our hard-earned grain. We tried to protect what we had, but every morning we found more gone. The new year came, and while others celebrated with laughter and feasts, we—the orphans—took our traps and went to the woods to catch mice for food.

By February 1978, it was time to prepare the rice fields again—luaj teb nplej.
Everyone in the village went to Havloj to clear and burn the fields for planting. We followed them, even though we didn’t have strong men to help chop down the big trees.

Families with fathers and grown sons took the good fields—the ones with large trees and rich soil. We only had Uncle Tswv Nploog, so our field was small and filled with thinner trees, still too many and too hard for us to clear easily.

Yet even then, I never felt completely alone. I always felt that someone—something—was with me.

Every morning I carried my kawm and my rab taumtxhob and went out to look for wild yam. Some days I found one early in the morning, some in the afternoon, and sometimes not until the sun was setting. Each one had its own lesson.

If I found a yam in the morning, I would dig all day, eight feet deep or more, to get enough for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. If I found one in the afternoon, it might be smaller—blocked by rocks beneath the soil—and I would dig only halfway. And if I found one in the evening, it would rest just a foot below the surface, circling around a big stone, as if it had been waiting for me.

Sometimes I found a single wild yam large enough to feed our family of ten for a whole week.

That is how I fed us—month after month—until the wild yams turned bitter and could no longer be eaten.

You may or may not believe this, but I do.
There is a God who loves the orphans.
He was with us then,
and I believe He is still with us now.

Reflection

Hunger taught me faith.
The earth gave roots, and heaven gave strength.
Even when no one saw us,
God’s hands were there in the soil.
