Summary: We settle again; Nomfue is born; we return to the opium fields at Teb Yeeb Avdaj to build and prepare for harvest.

Chapter Narrative: In August 1972, my brother Nomfue was born. A month or two later we went to our opium fields at Teb Yeeb Avdaj. My father’s plan was simple: finish the cabin at the first field. The day we arrived, he cut and split wood into shingles to roof the cabin. A rocky pit made the work difficult. Pieces of wood fell into the hole, and when he lifted them up to clear space, his hernia ruptured.

Toward evening—around five or six—Jude and I saw him hurry past us toward my mother, who was feeding Nomfue with Xeng Doua beside her. He lifted Xeng Doua onto his back and started down the trail toward the first field’s cabin, the path homeward. My mother called for us, and we gathered our things and followed, but we couldn’t catch up.

At the first field’s cabin, Father lay down in terrible pain. He said no words I can remember. We stayed the night. In the morning, my mother took all of us children back to the village, leaving Father with Grandma at the cabin. Rain fell so hard that no one could come help carry him home. We waited one or two days before moving him.

Reflection:
Sometimes life breaks in an instant—one lift too heavy, one step too deep. But even then, a father’s first thought is to carry his children. I will never forget the speed of his steps, even in pain.
