### Summary: Flooded paths, delayed rescue, and a father’s last words—asking that his children not be separated.

### Chapter Narrative: 
When we finally brought my father to the village, we knew we could not cure him. He needed to go to Long Cheng, but the rain poured like a river for a week. Before the end, he spoke to Grandma and Aunt Nyiaj Vws: “Take care of the four children. Do not separate them.”

He was once an orphan himself—the oldest of his brothers and sisters after their mother died. He knew the ache of hunger and the loneliness of growing up without parents. Perhaps that is why he spoke those words. He wanted to protect us from the kind of sorrow he had known.

My father’s last request was not for himself, but for us—to remain together. In that plea is the map he left me: family first, and love as the rope that binds us across every storm.
