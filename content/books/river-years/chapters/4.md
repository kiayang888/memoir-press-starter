Summary: Flooded paths, delayed rescue, and a father’s last words—asking that his children not be separated.

When we finally brought my father to the village, we knew we could not cure him. He needed to go to Long Cheng, but the rain poured like a river for a week. Before the end, he spoke to Grandma and Aunt Nyiaj Vws: “Take care of the four children. Do not separate them.”

He knew orphan life; he had been the eldest, carrying his brothers and sisters through hardship. He understood that staying together keeps children alive.

Reflection:
My father’s last request was not for himself, but for us—to remain together. In that plea is the map he left me: family first, and love as the rope that binds us across every storm.
