### Summary: After his death, nicknames arrive; after mother remarries, respect disappears; the three essentials for orphans, and the mercy of Grandma and Aunts.

### Chapter Narrative: 
Right after three months, new names began to follow me—Choj Nplog, Choj Ntswg Ntsuab, Choj Quaj Taug—and people looked at me differently. When my father died, the sadness was deep, but our family still gave us half-respect. When my mother remarried, that respect vanished. Only our closest aunts, uncles, and Grandma remained our shelter.

I have seen what orphans stare at with open mouths and great longing: rice, meat, and love. These three, only parents can truly give. We were blessed—Grandma and Aunt Nyiaj Vws wrapped us in compassion, and we took care of each other.

Losing respect can be as cold as hunger. But God gave us guardians—women who stood like mountains. Their love was our food.
