### Chapter Narrative

At that time, the cotton fields were ready for weeding, and Thai farmers hired refugees to help. Almost every morning, I went with the elders to pull weeds among the rows. We earned 20 baht a day, enough to buy a little food or soap.

When the cotton grew tall enough to shade out the weeds, tijlaug Ntsuab Pov found a new job for us—picking marble rocks at a quarry. We filled bulldozer scoops with white stone until each was full, earning the same 20 baht per day. It was hot, heavy work, but it gave us purpose.

Two of my cousins, Kuam Neeb and Nyiaj, worked there too. Nyiaj soon learned that I kept my money in my back pocket. He started following me everywhere—during work, during meals, even when we slept. I didn’t think much of it until one morning I woke up and found my pocket empty.

I cried and told uncle Lisfoom that someone had stolen my money.
“How much?” he asked.
“Five hundred baht,” I said.

Uncle told me not to worry—that we would find out who did it. “Go back to camp for now,” he said. “Tonight, I’ll call everyone together and ask who took it. If they confess, they must return it by morning. If not, whoever stole from an orphan will become poorer than an orphan.”

I left, angry and heartbroken. As I walked back toward camp, Nyiaj, the one who had stolen from me, followed me.
Halfway there, we passed a cotton field ready for picking. I thought to myself, If I go back to camp now, there’s nothing to do—and my money’s already gone. So I decided to work. Nyiaj followed me into the field.

I picked cotton all day and filled two 100-kilogram bags. When the owner weighed them, he handed me 10 baht.
That evening, I returned home tired but proud that I had still earned something honest.

The next day, uncle Lisfoom held his meeting as promised. He said aloud to everyone,

“Choj lost 500 baht last night while we were sleeping at the marble site. If anyone found it or took it, return it tonight—exactly as it was. Otherwise, the one who steals from an orphan will suffer worse than him.”

The next morning, yawg Nom Yeeb called uncle to his apartment. Someone had secretly returned the money overnight. Uncle gave it back to me, just as it was.

I learned something that day: even when people fall, guilt can still lead them toward decency.

#### Xeng Doua’s Sickness

When we came from Camp Kauthaus, both Xeng Doua and Neng Xue still had fever.
One evening, Grandma picked some wild greens—phav npoob—from the roadside on her way back from working the cotton fields and cooked them for dinner. That night, Xeng Doua got severe diarrhea. He couldn’t even make it to the bathroom. I dug small holes behind the fire pit so he could relieve himself nearby.

By the next morning, he was so weak he could barely move. Aunt Lisfoom told me to carry him to the hospital.
I carried him in my arms, terrified, as his breathing slowed. When we arrived, sick people were lying all around the hospital courtyard. Aunt Lisfoom went inside and returned with one Imodium tablet. I gave it to Xeng Doua, and within two hours, he started to recover. By evening, he was walking again—thin but alive.

Day by day, he grew stronger. It felt like watching a dying plant find rain again.

#### Reflection: In Ban Vinai, every small thing was sacred—a drink of water from a muddy well, a found coin, a meal shared, a brother’s life restored. Poverty taught us to see miracles not in heaven, but in the hands that held us up.
