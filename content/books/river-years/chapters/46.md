### Chapter Narrative

Life at Ban Vinai Refugee Camp felt like a dream—moving too fast, too soon.
After our final immigration interview, we received our T-number, the long-awaited ticket to America. Not long after the New Year, our number was called. It was time to prepare for departure.

We were told we would stay at Koos Thej Camp while waiting for our flight—usually for a month or so.
Someone warned me that there were many mosquitoes there, so I stitched together two mosquito nets into one big one, enough to cover the three of us.

#### Farewells and Departure

By February 1980, our T-number appeared on the list. The day we had dreamed about had finally come.
Around the camp, everyone was crying and visiting relatives for farewells. Families held little gatherings, cooking and talking late into the night.

But we were different—we weren’t sad. We were ready.
We could not wait for the bus to arrive.

When the buses finally came and the engines started, people wept and held hands through the windows.
We, though, were filled with restless excitement—ready to see the new camp, and then, America.

The bus drove the whole day, winding through mountains and villages. We arrived at Koos Thej Refugee Camp near nightfall. Floodlights lit the entrance as the guards directed everyone through the gate. We barely had time to look around before hearing our number called again.

The next morning, we went for our medical checkups. Then, before evening even came, our T-number was called once more—this time to prepare for boarding the bus to Npas Kauj Airport for our flight to the United States.

That same evening, the buses pulled up outside the camp gates. Families lined up, clutching their small bags.
I remember one of our Hmong brothers crossing the busy street near the gate; a Thai officer blew his whistle sharply, pulled him back, and kicked him hard. It was a reminder that until we left, we still had no country to protect us.

#### First Journey by Air

We rode through the night toward the airport.
When we arrived at Npas Kauj, I was amazed. All my life, I had never seen anything as beautiful as that building.
The floor was covered with carpets softer and cleaner than any clothes I had ever owned. The tiles shone so brightly I crouched down, rubbed my hand over them again and again, just to feel the smoothness. I couldn’t believe it was real.

Inside, families sat together on the floor, waiting. For dinner, they brought us fried chicken—the first time I had ever eaten it. Each person received a white foam tray with a piece of chicken and a small roll. I ate slowly, savoring the strange new taste.

The only problem was Xeng Doua—he needed to use the bathroom again and again.
Each time he said he had to go, uncle Lisfoom would yell at me to take him, even on the airplane.

When we finally boarded, I sat by the window.
The airplane was cold, bright, and full of smells I couldn’t name. The first time I tasted an apple was there, high above the clouds. I took one bite and wrinkled my nose—it tasted strange, almost like perfume. I set it down and smiled quietly to myself, wondering how a fruit could be so beautiful and so odd.

#### Between Worlds

We flew all night.
When the plane landed at Tokyo Airport, we were guided into a large waiting hall. There, they handed out our I-94 cards—the immigration forms for our entry into America.
I went through them one by one, sorting each card by the photograph, matching the faces I loved to the names printed in neat English letters.

That was the first time I saw my own name written as “So Thao.”
I stared at it for a long time. It felt strange and new—like a key to another world.
It was also the first time I saw all of your names, lined in letters that we could not yet read, but would one day call our own.

#### Reflection:
That night above the clouds, I learned what it meant to cross from one world to another—not just from Laos to Thailand, or Thailand to America, but from survival to hope. Everything ahead of us was unknown, but for the first time, the wind was at our backs.
