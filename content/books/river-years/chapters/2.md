Summary: Illness sweeps our family; nighttime flights to Long Cheng and Vientiane separate us; war breaks out and we flee again.

In 1970, sickness came to our house—my father, my sister Jude, Xeng Doua, and I. We flew to Long Cheng for treatment, but it wasn’t enough, so we continued on to Vientiane. By the time we arrived, it was already dark. They separated my mother, me, and Xeng Doua from Jude and my father. At dawn, my mother killed a hen, cooked rice, and we went looking for them. On the road, Uncle Vam Meej Vwj found us and took us to them. With many relatives staying together, space was tight; my mother and Xeng Doua flew back to Long Cheng, leaving Jude and my father behind. A month later, they rejoined us. My father’s hair was gone—lice had taken it all.

In 1971, war erupted in Long Cheng. We fled to Roob Tauj. My father and grandmother longed for a life like the old days—growing opium and rice—so we moved to Ban Nabmou.

Reflection:
Those years taught me that families can be torn apart and stitched back together in a single night. Distance and disease tried to scatter us, but love learned the roads and found a way.
