Summary:
Grandma gave us chores and divided us into pairs, teaching us responsibility. We learned to feed the younger children first and to work for food by helping others. Even as children, we raised chickens, pigs, and goats—small beginnings that gave us not only food, but also pride and hope.

Grandma believed in teaching responsibility early. She divided us into pairs and gave each group chores.
“You older ones can survive with little,” she said. “But the younger ones cannot. Make sure they eat first, or they may die.”

Ntsum and I were in charge of Doua and Povfwmyej. We worked together and always made sure they ate before we did.

Grandma also knew children needed more than rice. She made an agreement with Nyiaj Nplaib: if we weeded his rice fields, he would give us a pig and chickens. For a week we worked hard, and he kept his promise. Each of us was given a hen to raise.

By July 1974, our hens laid eggs. I dug coops into the earth to keep chicks warm. We claimed parts of the chickens for future meals—heads, wings, even rooster testicles—laughing as children do.

That year, our chickens thrived, our pig gave birth, and Uncle Lisfoom gave us goats. Life was sad in many ways, but also full of blessings. We had enough to eat, enough to share, and enough to help others.

Reflection:
Raising animals, caring for siblings, and working in the rice fields were hard tasks for children. But it was in those responsibilities that we grew strong. Grandma’s wisdom—that the young must eat first—remains with me. It was a lesson in selflessness, in putting others before myself, and it shaped how I see family and love to this day.old.
