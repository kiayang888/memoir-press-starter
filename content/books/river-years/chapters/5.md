Summary: We return to the fields in sorrow; Mother cannot work for tears; I choose school; Uncle Lisfoom steps in to help us study and live.

Chapter Narrative: After my father passed, my mother, baby Nomfue, and I went back to the first field to prepare for planting. But she could only walk and weep; grief carried her from side to side while Nomfue cried and wet my back. I made a decision then: I would surrender the field and go to school. I told my mother, and from that day on, I only helped on weekends.

Uncle Lisfoom came and took care of us. He sent us to school, just as I had hoped. I was good at drawing and singing and made good grades. The hardest part was completing projects without a father’s help. But I had uncles—Txoov Neeb (Chongneng) and Knehg Tze (Neej Zeb)—and friends who were orphans like us. We helped each other, cutting bamboo for supplies and finishing our projects better than most.

Reflection:
Grief pushed me toward learning. When fields were too heavy for my small hands, books became my tools. God opened a door where a wall had stood.
