Summary

This chapter shows a turning point for yourthe family: conflict, decision, rebuilding, and survival. In 1976, we moved again—this time to build a new home at Zos Tiajqhib.
Arguments, loss, and exhaustion followed us, but we kept building. Our new house became a promise: that family would endure, even after everything else was gone.

Chapter Narrative

After the New Year celebration—sometime in mid-January of 1976—Uncle Ntxoov Yias’s older brother, Tooj Txhim Vwj, came from Nabhiab to ask him and the rest of our relatives to move there. Grandma was eager to go, hoping to be close to family again.

At that time, Uncle Lisfoom had already remarried Aunt Lisfoom, but he had gone to visit relatives in Ban Phuvvias. Grandma and all of us orphans packed our few belongings, gathered our goats, pigs, and chickens, and joined the group heading toward Nabhiab. We walked for an entire day and another morning before stopping to rest near an old rice field.

There, Uncle Lisfoom met us on his way back from Phuvvias. He was upset when he learned that Grandma was planning to move again. He didn’t want us to go at all, but Grandma insisted. The argument between them lasted for nearly half an hour—until Uncle Ntxoov Yias stepped forward and spoke clearly.

He told Grandma, “I am not your birth son. I am only your son-in-law. I cannot take full responsibility for you and the children. That duty belongs to Lisfoom—he is your son.”

Grandma was silent for a long moment. Then she sighed and agreed to return with Uncle Lisfoom back to the village.

It took us another full day to walk home. But peace did not come easily. Grandma and Uncle Lisfoom began to argue often. Grandma later told me that one day, in anger, Uncle Lisfoom swung an axe near her side, the blade striking the ground beside her. Their disagreement came from a simple wish—Grandma wanted a small house built for us. Uncle Lisfoom refused; he wanted to claim Uncle Ntxoov Yias’s house as his own.

Grandma told him, “That house belongs to your brother’s wife, not to you. You are a man—build your own home, and let me have this one for me and the children.”

The tension grew until Aunt Lisfoom quietly stood up and took me with her to the forest. Together, we cut nplooj kavtheej (palm leaves) to build the roof. We bundled them up, carried them back to the village, and began the work ourselves.

When Uncle Lisfoom saw what Aunt Lisfoom and Grandma were doing, his anger softened. Together, they decided to build a new home—but in another village, called Zos Tiajqhib.

By mid-1976, our new house stood complete. It was small, but it was ours. Soon after, we began preparing the rice fields for planting.

We were thirteen members in the household then:

Lisfoom, Aunt Lisfoom, Grandma, Blong (13), Chong Neng (12), Mos (11), Iab (10), Maum / Maiv Thoj (9), Kneng Ze (7), Choj (12), Ntsum (10), Doua (7), Povfwmyej (4)

Aunt Mab had already married Uncle Nyiaj Vws shortly after the New Year of 1974–1975, so she was no longer with us by this time.

Even though our days were filled with rebuilding, arguments, and hard labor, there was a quiet strength that held us together—a stubborn will to survive and start anew.

Reflection

A house is not built from wood alone,
but from the hands that refuse to give up.
Even in anger, even in sorrow,
love still builds what fear tries to break.
