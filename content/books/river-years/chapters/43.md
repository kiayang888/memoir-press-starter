### Chapter Narrative

When we first arrived at Ban Vinai Camp, the rice fields nearby were just ripening, golden in the sun.
There was no water well in all of Camp 6, so every family had to dig their own. A small creek ran beside the camp, and soon families began digging wells along its banks—two or three families sometimes sharing one. Before long, there were so many holes that the creek itself ran dry.

It was almost funny: each new well sat so close to the next that the dirty water from the upper one drained into the next below. People didn’t just draw water—they bathed and washed clothes there, too. We all laughed about it later, but at the time, it was simply how life was.

#### Digging Our Own Well

I remember going with uncle Lisfoom to txiv dablaug Vajthaiv Vaj at Camp 4 to borrow a shovel so we could dig a well for our family—hlob Tsuj Txhiab, txiv Nplooj, yawg laus Vam Xeeb, and txiv dablaug Xaiv Neeb were all sharing with us.
When we arrived, tijlaug Tswv Nkaub Lis was already there. We greeted each other warmly, proud to see familiar faces again. He told us that he was planning to go back to Laos to bring his father and my mother to Thailand.

Uncle Lisfoom then asked if we could use tijlaug Tswv Nkaub Lis’s refugee account to help us come to the United States sooner. He agreed, saying his account was already near the front of the interview list—and since he would not be available, we could use it.

Right there, they exchanged information. That was how I received my name “So Thao”, and uncle Lisfoom became “Kao Lee Thao.”
My name came from my stepsister Chau Lee’s, and his came from tijlaug Tswv Nkaub Lis’s. Since uncle was the head of household, they couldn’t remove the “Lee,” so they simply added “Thao” to it—Lee-Thao, a joining of names that symbolized family and opportunity.

When we got back to Camp 6 with the shovel, we first planned to dig between Camp 1 and our own camp. But something—or someone—made us change our minds. So we went and dug near the others, along the creek. Soon our well joined the line of many others.

#### Morning Lines and Little Miracles

At Camp 1, there was a CAMA (Christian and Missionary Alliance) program that provided milk and crackers for the children—Xeng Doua, Kneng Ze, Nomfue, Txoov Kav, and Xauv Mas among them. Every morning they lined up for their rations, then scattered to play or hunt grasshoppers.

One morning, Xeng Doua found another 500-baht bill on the ground.
He brought it straight to me. I used part of it to buy myself a new shirt and pair of pants, but most of it I spent on boiled chicken and rice for him to eat, to help regain his strength.
