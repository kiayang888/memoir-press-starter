Summary:

This chapter marks a major transition: another journey, another separation, another survival. It’s rich with motion, hardship, and the quiet resilience of the family.
In 1977, our family split in two—some stayed, and ten of us followed Grandma to Phamphais.
We crossed rivers, carried animals, and lived by what nature gave us. Malaria haunted the villages, and once again, we were forced to move to survive.

Chapter Narrative:

After the New Year of 1976–1977, we went to carry all the rice we had stored in the fields back home. Soon after, the new rice season began, and in 1977 we prepared the fields near our village.

When the fields were ready, Grandma decided to visit her older sister, Niam Tais Ntxoov Xeeb Lauj, in Phuvlaj, and Txiv Hlob Npliaj Npis in Phamphais.
When she returned, she told us to pack. She said we would move to live with Txiv Hlob Npliaj Npis.

I don’t remember whether she and Uncle Lisfoom argued about it or not, but we began packing anyway. Grandma bought a red horse to carry most of our belongings.

She took with her: Uncle Tswv Nploog, Uncle Chong Neng, Aunt Mos, Aunt Iab, Aunt Maum, Uncle Kneng Ze, Chong K (me), Jude, Doua, Povfwmyej

We brought along a sow, six goats, and a few chickens. Grandma’s plan was to go and live with Txiv Hlob Npliaj Npis in Phamphais. Our family divided into two groups. Those who stayed—Uncle Lisfoom, Aunt Lisfoom, Yeeb, and Voos. Those who left—the ten of us, led by Grandma, walking toward a new place, a new village, and new relatives.

It took us an entire week to walk. Each day was long and dusty. Along the way, one of our goats gave birth to two small lambs. We stopped until they were dry, then carried them and continued walking.

When we reached the River Najtheem, we spent nearly a full day trying to get the goats to cross. The water was strong and deep. We were many—and we were wild.

We didn’t have a father to hunt or provide for us, so we had learned to survive by catching what we could in the creeks and ponds—fish, tadpoles, beetles, and crabs. As we approached Txiv Hlob Npliaj Npis’s village, we found streams full of shrimp, fish, and crabs, and our hearts filled with excitement. We felt that maybe this new place would be good to us.

Looking back, I realize how much we owe Txiv Hlob Npliaj Npis and his family. Without them, we might not have survived. Malaria—what we called dab ntxaug, the spirit that stole people’s souls—was spreading fast. The villagers there already knew how dangerous it was.

We had been in the village less than a week when Txiv Hlob Npliaj Npis warned Grandma that our family was at risk. He told her, “You must move again. Go to Phuvlaj, where Niam Tais Ntxoov Xeeb Lauj and Txiv Hlob Ntxoov Vaj Thoj (Ntxoov Vaj Rog) live.”

And so, before we could even rest, we packed our things once more—ready to walk again, toward another unknown home.

Reflection:

The road was never kind, but it always led us where we needed to be. Even in fear and hunger, we learned that survival was a kind of faith.
