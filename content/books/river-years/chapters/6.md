### Summary: Small, bright fragments—hunting squirrels, setting traps, sharing meat, walking barefoot over stones; trying not to forget his face.

### Chapter Narrative: 
If there were still time, I would spend more of it with him. It hurts that I barely remember his face or all he did. I remember one August evening, the year he would pass, when my mother was still nyob nruab hlis after Nomfue’s birth. He took me to finish the first cabin and to hunt squirrels. I puckered my lips to make sounds and he hushed me.

He loved setting traps and hunting. He caught nploos and cooked them, inviting grandparents working nearby to share. He saved me a piece of thigh meat—bitter and unforgettable. I lay sick on the bed that day, watching his barefoot footprints mark the rafters, as if his steps were everywhere. We had no shoes—none of us did—just feet toughened by rocks and brush, in every season of our lives.

What remains are fragments: a hush in the woods, a bitter taste, bare feet on beams, and a father’s quiet generosity. These pieces are enough to keep him living in my heart.
