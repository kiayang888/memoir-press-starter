Summary

This chapter captures a powerful and tense moment in yourthe family’s story: scarcity, war, and resilience through labor. In 1976, hunger ruled the land. We risked our lives for rice left near the warfront and carried it home through the night. Through months of labor and hunger, we found strength in survival.

Chapter Narrative

During this time, everywhere the Hmong lived, people were rising up against the Laotian government. Many fled from their homes and moved to the areas where we lived. Life became harder each day—there was little rice, no salt, and no sugar.

By 1976, as we began preparing the rice fields, our food supplies were completely gone. Not only us, but every relative nearby was also out of rice, salt, and sugar. The few grains left were stretched as far as love and hunger could allow.

Because so many Hmong families who had joined the resistance moved into our area, all the rice soon disappeared. But we heard that the Phubthawj, who had also risen with the Hmong, had left behind their rice in their village near the border—the front line between the Hmong and the Lao government.

Uncle Lisfoom, Aunt Lisfoom, Uncle Tswv Nploog, Aunt Mos, Uncle Chong Neng, and I joined many relatives on a secret journey to recover that rice. We traveled at night, walking quietly through the jungle and over the dark hills, our hearts pounding at every sound.

We reached the village under moonlight, gathered as much rice as we could carry, and began the long walk back before dawn. That night, I carried the heaviest load I had ever lifted in my life. My shoulders burned, but I kept walking—for Grandma, for my brothers, for everyone who was hungry and waiting.

By daylight, we were far from the front line. We hid our sacks of rice in a cave near the Najxoj River, close to the field we were preparing. That cave became our secret granary, a small promise of survival in a season of emptiness.

That year’s harvest was long and weary. From June to September, Uncle Tswv Nploog, Uncle Chong Neng, Aunt Mos, Aunt Iab, and I stayed in the field, weeding from sunrise to dusk. We had no chance to return home to the village.

When the rice finally grew tall enough to shade the ground and cover the weeds, we stood back and watched it wave in the wind—our work, our hope, our food. Only then did we return home, tired but alive.

Reflection:

Hunger teaches what words cannot—
the worth of salt, the weight of rice, the grace of endurance. Even in fear and emptiness, hope still finds a way to grow.
