Summary

This chapter captures a terrifying moment of flight and survival. You’re describing not just movement, but displacement — that feeling of being chased by war, carrying fear, family, and faith together. This section bridges danger and the longing for safety, and it deserves to flow like a memory caught between panic and prayer.

Chapter Narrative

One morning, just as we had woken up, Yij Nyiaj Pov’s brother came running toward us, shouting,
“Nyajlaj tuaj pem zos lawm! — the soldiers are coming from the village!”

Everyone began packing in panic. There was no time to eat, no time to think. We grabbed what little we could carry and ran.

As we reached the edge of the village, we could already see the soldiers marching in—armed, shouting, their boots heavy on the dirt paths we used to play on. Yij Nyiaj Pov’s brother yelled, “Everyone’s fleeing down the hill!”

We turned around immediately, changed our direction, and ran toward where the villagers had gone. Before long, we caught up with Aunt Iab, Aunt Maum, Uncle Kneng Ze, Xeng Doua, and Nomfue. They were with the other villagers, moving quickly down the slopes away from the danger.

We stayed with them for about two hours, resting under the trees, listening to the sounds of gunfire echoing in the distance. Then we started fleeing again—this time even farther, away from the enemy lines.

Eventually, we reached the area near our old rice field, the same one where Uncle Tswv Nploog and I had weeded before—the same place where we had once spent a night of fear and shadows. There was an empty rice-field cabin, and we stayed there for a week.

After several days, soldiers from our side arrived and fought back against the enemy. The fighting was fierce, but eventually, the enemy retreated.

Even so, it was not safe. We went back to our village at night to gather our clothes and belongings. The air was still thick with smoke and fear. The houses were quiet, the fields torn.

But the worst part was the fleas. They had taken over everything—houses, floors, blankets. Even though we ran quickly in and out, we were covered in bites when we reached the outskirts again.

When the gunfire stopped and peace returned, Grandma still refused to go back. She said the house no longer felt like home, that the ground itself had turned cold.

At that time, Yawg Nom Lwm, Yij Nom Pov Yaj, and Hlob Vam Teev were living at zos Tiaj Nyom—near tshav nyoob hoom Phamphais, the old airstrip where Uncle Chong Neng had once fallen ill and died. Grandma decided that we would move there too—to live near them, to start again somewhere safer, even if the world around us still trembled.

Reflection

War teaches you to move before you can think.
Home becomes the place where no one is shooting.
And peace, when it comes, is only the sound of breathing in the dark.
