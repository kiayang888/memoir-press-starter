### Chapter Narrative

Life in Ban Vinai was both sad and proud, filled with pain yet lit by small victories that gave us confidence to hope again.

#### The Sadness
The first sadness was Grandma.
She was furious when she discovered that uncle Tswv Nploog had completed his immigration papers listing himself as an orphan, stating that his mother had passed away. Whatever the reason or misunderstanding behind it, it broke her heart. Her anger burned so deep that she became careless toward us three brothers. From that moment, she rarely spoke to us or cared what happened. Her love seemed lost in disappointment.

The second sadness was my mother. She was in Camp 3, and I often went to visit her—sometimes staying a night or two—but she never came to see us, not even Xeng Doua or Nomfue.
Once, uncle Paj Tsab Vue, her brother, was preparing to leave for America, and she asked me to join her and my stepfather to visit him. They held a small party that evening. I remember lying down on their bed and falling asleep while they were still talking and laughing.  When I woke up in the morning, the house was empty. No one had waited for me. That moment told me everything I didn’t want to believe—that her love had gone somewhere I could not reach.

The third sadness was Xeng Doua’s illness.
He got severe diarrhea—so bad that he was dying in my arms as I carried him downhill to the hospital. No one helped, except aunt Lisfoom, who walked ahead of us. The hospital yard was crowded with sick people lying on the ground, waiting. Aunt Lisfoom told us to wait outside with the others while she went to get medicine.

After a while, she returned with one Imodium tablet. I gave it to Xeng Doua, and he swallowed it. Within an hour, his fever dropped, and he stood up—weak but alive. We walked home together, as if nothing had happened, though his body was thin as a stick. It felt like a miracle.

The fourth sadness was labor and loss.

Since our first day at Ban Vinai, I worked in the cotton fields to earn a little food money. One day Xeng Doua found a 500-baht bill, and from then on we always had a little saved in my pocket. But while we were working at a rock-picking site, a cousin stole all the money from me.

The good thing was, guilt must have moved him—he returned it all.
The fifth sadness was the day we left for America.
Our mother never came. No farewell, no meal, no wave, no tears—just silence. We boarded the bus alone.

#### The Pride
But life in Ban Vinai was not all sorrow.
There were moments of pride—small, shining lights that proved we were still standing.
The first pride was Xeng Doua’s survival.

He had nearly died in my arms more than once, but somehow, each time, he recovered.
He was thin but strong. He and the younger boys—Kneng Ze, Nomfue, Hlau, and Xauv Mas—each made their own slingshots from rubber bands. Every day they went out hunting grasshoppers. In the mornings they lined up at Camp 1 for milk and crackers, then spent the rest of the day chasing insects through the fields, laughing like wild children reborn.

The second pride was Xeng Doua’s heart.
Even when he was the weakest and needed food the most, he still thought of others. One morning while in the cracker line, he found another 500-baht bill and brought it straight to me. I went to the Thai market and bought a new shirt and pants for myself—but every morning after that, I used the rest of the money to buy boiled chicken in plastic bags for him to eat. Watching him eat made me feel rich.

The third pride was that we three orphans were, in truth, richer than anyone expected.
Not because of money, but because we had survived every storm together.

The fourth pride was that we didn’t stay long.
We spent only six months in Ban Vinai, and just one night in Koos Thej, before leaving for America. Unlike many others, we were spared the long years of waiting.

#### The Confidence

What gave us strength was hope.
There was no more war, and we knew we were headed to America. I continued to work the cotton fields, earning small wages to buy food for Xeng Doua, Nomfue, and sometimes Voos. I even paid to take evening English classes, determined to be ready for the new world.
I became the only one in our family who could speak a little English—and, in those nights under the dim light of the camp, I also learned to read and write Hmong.

#### Reflection: Ban Vinai was a valley of sorrow and pride—where the wounds of the past bled into the hope of a new beginning. We arrived there as orphans of war, but we left as students of faith, carrying nothing but courage, language, and the will to live again.
