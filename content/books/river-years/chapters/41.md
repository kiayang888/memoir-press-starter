Chapter Narrative

Inside Camp Kauthaus there was a small clinic for the sick, and a central open space surrounded by shelters. In the middle was the feeding area, where the Thai soldiers distributed food twice a day—lunch and dinner.

They fed us the way they fed their livestock. Each day, we lined up and waited for scoops of rice and watery vegetables. Sometimes there were bits of tobacco or dirt in the food, but we ate it anyway. Hunger left no room for pride.

During the day, most people gathered in the open courtyard to stand in the sunlight or find relief from the rain. At night, when it didn’t rain, everyone lay down in that same open space—head to head, foot to head—like herds of pigs or cows packed together for warmth. If it rained, people crowded under the small cabins around the edge of the courtyard and stood all night long, half asleep, waiting for dawn.

There were toilets, but they were unusable. The pits were filled with maggots, piled one to two feet deep, writhing like a moving wave. Most people waited until dark to relieve themselves a hundred feet from the main crowd.

We lived there for about a month. During that time, Xeng Doua and Neej Xwm fell ill with fever. The symptoms weren’t severe, but the fever returned twice a day. Even so, we were thankful—they were still alive, and soon we would be leaving.
