### Summary: In 1975, everything changed. The communists took over Laos, and families like ours were caught in fear and flight. We followed General Vang Pao, fled, returned, and fled again—always searching for safety, always hoping for freedom.

### Chapter Narrative: 
By May 1975, communists took control of Laos. Long Cheng filled with people fleeing by airlift. That month, Uncle Lisfoom took me, Uncle Tswvnploog, Uncle Chong Neng, and his family to Roobtuaj, following General Vang Pao toward Thailand.

At Heemhawj, fighting broke out. Many died or were wounded. We turned back to Ban Nabmub.

By September, Uncle Lisfoom and Xaiv Suav rose against the government. Our family moved constantly—from opium farms to Ban Najxoj (Roob Kub Nyhiab). From late 1975 to March 1977, we lived there.

During this time, Uncle Lisfoom was left a single father. His wife had left him, and Grandma stayed behind with the girls and younger boys. Plans began for us to cross into Thailand. If there was a chance, we promised, we would return for the others.

When the communists took over Laos, the world we knew fell apart. We became wanderers, moving from one place to another, never certain of tomorrow. Yet even in fear, I saw the hand of God protecting us. Our plans to cross into Thailand were born out of hope—a hope that no matter how broken the world became, there was still a future waiting for us.
