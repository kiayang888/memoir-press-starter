### Chapter Narrative

The plan was for us youths to go ahead and sleep at our second field at Tiaj Tsawb; Grandma and aunt Mos would follow after dark. At first light, we would meet uncle Lisfoom at his field deeper in the forest—right where the journey would begin.

We—Knehg Ze, Iab, Xeng Doua, Maum, Nomfue, and I—took two horses and the goats and left at noon. We dropped the animals with niam hlob Npliaj Npis at Thasxes / zos Tiaj Qhib and continued to Tiaj Tsawb. We arrived near sunset, settled in, and waited. That night wasn’t long before Grandma and aunt Mos arrived, and we all moved on to uncle Lisfoom’s field as planned.

There were far more people than we expected. We reunited with tijlaug Ntsuab Pov, others, and two Thai guides. We moved into the forest, then stopped to wait for yawg laus and phauj Vaj Tsheej Vaj, who had not yet caught up. We waited two hours or more before they arrived from Phuvmeem.

Day 1 in the jungle, we followed a creek all day and built tsev pheebsuab for the night. Few of us were mindful of the monsoon; it was only late May. Our family camped right by the creek, on a spot barely a foot above the water. It poured all night. By morning, the creek had flooded. Everything on the lower ground—our fire pit—was gone. My brand-new shoes were gone. From that day until Thailand, I was barefoot like the rest. As we followed the creek after breakfast, I found one shoe washed up—but not the other.

Ours was the largest family: Iab, Maum, Knengh Ze, Xeng Doua, Nomfue, Yeeb, and Voos were all small; only Iab might carry a little rice. Uncle Lisfoom, a military man, read the compass and led most of the time, so we usually walked front of the column.

We climbed ridge after ridge, crossed valleys and rivers. The day we reached the Phuvmeem trail, evening fell before we could cross with the main group. We camped by the path with other families; the rest had made it to the far side.

Yawg laus Nom Neeb Vwj and his relatives traveled with us because his nephew—the son of Ntxoov Vaj Vwj, sixteen or eighteen—was very sick. They carried him for three or four days, but eventually father and son surrendered at Phuvmeem. Two days later, Ntxoov Vaj caught up alone, sobbing that his son had died. He left the body where they had parted.
