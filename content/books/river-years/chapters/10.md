Summary:
This chapter tells of the first time I went to visit my mother after the monsoon season. Though I was excited for new clothes and shoes for the New Year Festival, I also faced fear—walking alone through mountains and valleys to return home. What began as a child’s journey for clothes became a lesson in faith, courage, and God’s unseen protection.

Chapter Narrative: When the monsoon season ended and Tsiab Pebcaug, the New Year Festival, was near, Grandma told me to visit my mother and ask her for new clothes and shoes. Every year—whether it was the start of school or the coming of New Year—Grandma would remind me to go to my mother for such things.

At that time, the opium farming season was also in full swing, much like the autumn harvests elsewhere. Vegetables were plentiful, and Aunt Mab, along with Aunt Vamteev and the others, often brought their produce to market. Early one morning, I went with them, planning to visit my mother. I did not know exactly where she lived—what village or what house—but Aunt Vamteev had some idea. When we reached her village, she pointed and said, “That is your mother’s house.”

The house was not yet finished, but I knocked on the door. My two stepsisters, Cho and Cha, answered. I stayed with my mother for a few days, and during that time she bought me new clothes and shoes.

When it was time to return home, no one from my village happened to be passing by. My mother asked if I remembered the way back. I told her yes, but admitted I was scared. The journey was two to three hours on foot, crossing mountains and valleys, with dense jungle between villages. She comforted me:
“Don’t be afraid. I will walk you to the main trail. Many people pass by there. Walk with them, and you will make it home.”

She took me to the edge of the village and said goodbye. From there, I walked alone. People passed me on the trail, but when they saw a small boy traveling by himself, they grew frightened, thinking I might be a ghost. They avoided me, never asking who I was or where I was going.

To keep myself company, I made a neeszab—a pretend horse. I used a long stick, bouncing its tip against the ground so it skipped along ahead of me. I held on to one end and slid it forward, letting it “lead” me down the trail. Together, my stick-horse and I walked the mountains and valleys until I reached home.

I learned then: when you are alone and afraid, but you know the way forward, have faith. The Lord will guide your steps.

That journey to my mother’s house taught me courage. Even though I was only a child, walking alone through mountains and valleys, I learned that fear can be overcome with faith. Sometimes in life, people will avoid you, just as travelers avoided me on the trail. But even when no one walks with you, the Lord never leaves your side.
