### Summary: Where we laid my father to rest; the three-morning rituals; too few spoons at the table; a festival journey where I learn my mother has remarried.

### Chapter Narrative: 
They buried my father by the road we took to the fields, between the dry creek that ran from Rooj Majmum and the airstrip (tshav nyoob hoom). They even cut a quarter of the trail to make space for his grave. For three mornings we followed custom: first to the grave, then halfway, then only to the fire pit. At lunch that same day, we called to our departed. We had three family members gone and only so many spoons; sometimes three of us shared one, passing it hand to hand, careful not to cross arms.

During Npushauvnab, the Lao water festival in April 1973, Grandma, my mother, Aunt Nyiaj Vws, and Aunt Txhiaj Cua went to get rice from Vajfoom village. Grandma told me, Uncle Chongneng, and Uncle Knengze to wait for them in the mountains between Huabkhibnees and Tsuanoogroov. We left at eight in the morning, climbed, and waited—but they didn’t return. As the sun lowered, we feared the graveyard on the way home. I knew the path to Grandma and Grandpa Shoua Ying Vue’s house over Roob Huabkib, so I led us down the dusty road.

We stayed three days and four nights, doing wild things with my uncle Ma. On the fourth morning we headed home. At the stream where travelers took lunch, I heard my mother’s voice behind me: “Ab Choj! Ab Choj, where have you been?” She stood with a group of men, Nomfue on her back. They were eating a wedding lunch. She cried a little. My new stepfather pressed some money into my hand—hundreds of kip—and shared food with us. Then they sent us home, saying Uncle and Grandma were worried.

We crossed Houakineng village and finally met Uncle Lisfoom, Grandma, and Aunt Nyiaj Vws. Uncle shouted, “Where have you carried your bones to?” and I told him all we had done. That day I knew my mother had remarried.

Reflection:
Rituals carried our grief; roads carried our news. One path led me to my father’s grave, another to my mother’s new life. Between them, I learned to keep walking.
