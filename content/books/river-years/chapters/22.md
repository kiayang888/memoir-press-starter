Short Summary

This chapter is both heartbreaking and deeply human — it shows the raw struggle of survival, the loss of a sister, and the quiet resilience of daily life when everything depended on the land and the will to keep going.

Chapter Narrative

By April of 1977, after we had seeded the rice into the ground, there was nothing left to eat. The fields were planted, but the earth was bare of food. Hunger came quietly at first, then it stayed.

We began digging for wild yams to survive. There were three kinds we knew: qos toj nqeeb, qos zoov, and qos daj nco.
The qos toj nqeeb was the easiest to find, but the roots were small—too small for a family of ten.

At first, Grandma and Uncle Kneng Ze tried to dig some, but they came back nearly empty-handed. Then Jude and I decided to try. We went out in the morning and dug until evening, our hands blistered from the soil, our stomachs aching. That day, we came home with enough yams for all ten of us to eat dinner, breakfast, and lunch.

So that became our life. Each day, Jude and I left early to dig, returning at dusk with baskets full of roots. The bitter taste of qos toj nqeeb became the flavor of survival. We did that every day—until the day Jude passed away.

After that, I continued alone, digging wild yams through the long, hot months until the middle of September 1977.

During this time, after the rice and corn were planted, Grandma and Uncle Tswv Nploog worked on finishing the house. Uncle Chong Neng and I took care of the goats and the red horse.

There were many bees in that region—ntab, muv, muv doom, and mes—each kind making its own honey. We often saw the bees gather near the animals. The red horse began to suffer; the ntab bees chewed at him every day.

We tried to help him by lighting a bonfire beneath him to keep the bees away, but the fire couldn’t last all day. The horse needed to move from place to place to graze, and the bees would always return.

Each day it grew worse. One morning, the red horse could no longer stand. By evening, he was gone.

Not long after, the monsoon arrived. The rain fell hard and steady, flooding the fields, and it was time to weed the rice again. But inside, it felt as though another kind of storm had already passed through us—one made of loss, hunger, and the will to keep surviving.

Reflection

Hunger teaches more than pain.
It teaches how strong love can be,
how a root becomes a meal,
and how the living carry the memory of the lost.
