### Summary:  This chapter captures a moment of unrest and rebuilding: new beginnings shadowed by loss, hunger, and mistrust. As the fields burned, we moved to Puvlaj to begin again. We built our new home amid conflict, hunger, and smoke. Neighbors shared what little they had, until even the rice was gone.

### Chapter Narrative

It was the time of year when farmers were burning their rice fields to prepare for planting again. The sky was filled with gray smoke that hung over the valleys like a blanket. That was when we packed up and moved once more.

Uncle Xwm Lauj, the son of Niam Tais Ntxoov Xeeb Lauj, came to help us. When we arrived in Puvlaj, we stayed at Niam Tais Ntxoov Xeeb’s home. Her son Hlob Vws was the head of the household, and Phauj Kawm was the one who led everyone in the daily work and family duties.

Not long after arriving, we began preparing a new house in a village about an hour’s walk from Niam Tais Ntxoov Xeeb’s home. During that time, we faced our first problem—someone had stolen a quarter of Grandma’s opium.

We knew that Niam Tais Ntxoov Xeeb and her son Txiaj Xab and his wife also smoked opium, so Grandma asked them kindly about it. But no one admitted to it. The conversation turned tense, and conflict followed between the families.

Even through the tension, we continued to build. The house wasn’t finished yet, but we had to move in anyway. Grandma gave each of us our responsibilities. Uncle Chong Neng and I were in charge of taking the goats out to graze and watching over them, then bringing them back each evening. At the same time, I also had to care for Xeng Doua and feed the red horse.

During this period, more and more Hmong families moved into the area. Uncle Vws and others had their rice burned by the spreading fires from the dry fields.

Many families had lived there for years before us, but now even they had little left. Everyone shared what rice they had so that others could seed their fields again. Soon, all the rice was gone—along with the salt, sugar, and clothing.

The smoke that once rose from burning fields now felt like the hunger rising in every home.

We built our home with empty hands, and shared our hunger like a meal.
Even when the fire took everything, we learned that sharing kept us alive.
