Summary

This is a powerful chapter — a bridge between sorrow and endurance, showing how the pain of loss turned into quiet perseverance and strange, haunting nights. It carries both physical hardship and spiritual fear — themes that flow beautifully with the rhythm of your memoir so far.

Chapter Narrative

After Jude passed away in late August or early September, most of the family became sick. Only Uncle Tswv Nploog and I remained well. Even though our hearts were heavy, the rice still needed weeding, and there was no one else to do it.

Early one morning, we set out toward the other field—about two hours away. As we passed Hlob Ntsuab Kos Thoj’s house, somewhere between zos Phuvlaj and his home, I tripped and fell. The sickle slid out of my basket and cut my arm. It wasn’t deep, but the scar is still there today, a small reminder of that morning.

We worked in the field for nearly a week. The days were long, and the nights cold. On the final evening, we didn’t want to walk back to our old place—it was down the hill, far from the path home. Nearby, about a hundred yards away, there was a small Phubthawj’s cabin.

Not far from us, another family was also weeding their field. As night fell, Uncle Tswv Nploog asked me to go ask for some fire to cook our meal. I walked through the dark to their camp. When I asked, in Lao, if I could “borrow some fire,” they laughed kindly and said,
“You don’t borrow fire—you’re given fire.”

They shared their flame, and I carried it carefully back to our hut. We cooked dinner over it, the firelight dancing across the bamboo walls.

After we ate, we laid down to rest. That night was one I will never forget. The darkness felt alive, as if something unseen was watching. Uncle Tswv Nploog struggled all night, whispering, gasping, and shaking—tsog tsuam, as we called it, the weight of a spirit pressing on his chest.

Each time it came, I reached over and shook him awake. My heart raced, afraid not only for him but for what might be hovering nearby.

We made it through the night somehow, sleepless but safe. At dawn, the mist hung thick over the valley, and we began our walk home—tired, sore, but grateful to still see the morning light.

Reflection

Some nights feel longer than life itself.
When fear comes, you learn the strength of staying awake—
and how one small fire can hold back the dark.
