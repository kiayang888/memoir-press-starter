### Chapter Narrative

I didn’t know the plans Grandma, aunt Lisfoom, and uncle Lisfoom had made. Grandma asked uncle Tong Toua Thoj to help her cross. Aunt Lisfoom, Yeeb, and Voos asked dablaug Xaiv Neeb Muas to help them. The seven of us remained with uncle Lisfoom, waiting for a boat so we could all cross together. But we had no money. Grandma carried her own silver. Aunt Lisfoom had some but didn’t share with uncle Lisfoom. Boats charged 2 choj nyiaj per person.

We waited until 5:00 a.m. No boats. Uncle Lisfoom decided we would swim across.

He gave me a rope. I tied myself to Xeng Doua and to whoever was next in line. We stepped into the Mekong, ten feet from shore—and boats appeared, nosing into the bank. People surged aboard. Uncle Lisfoom kept one hand on the gunwale while we held the rope, floating beside. The boat hauled us toward mid-river, the border. Then the boatman and his helper robbed the passengers, stripping them of silver—pay or be thrown to the water.

After they finished, they demanded our payment. As I remember, uncle Lisfoom said, “I’m in the water holding the boat. I can’t reach money. Wait until shore.”

On the Thai bank, daylight broke. The boatmen ran. One even grabbed my knife, slipped into the water, and swam away.

I thought then: if uncle Lisfoom had dragged all seven of us swimming, we might have tangled in the rope and drowned near shore. If we had tried to board, without the 16 choj we needed, we might have been dumped into the river. Instead, we held on to the side—and eight of us crossed one of the world’s great rivers without paying a coin.

It was faith and the Lord’s kindness—a path of water turned into a path of deliverance.

(And the two Thai guides who had first come with tijlaug Ntsuab Pov—they, too, went back with us as far as needed.)

#### Reflection:
On jungle paths and riverbanks, you only carry what matters. That night at the Mekong, we carried faith, a rope, and each other—and it was enough.
