Beautiful — this chapter marks another return to survival, but now with the weight of loss and quiet resilience.

The image of sleeping on top of the rice basket is unforgettable — a perfect symbol of both hunger and hope.

Chapter Narrative

When we arrived at zos Tiaj Nyom, near the airstrip at Phamphais, it was just about time to prepare the rice fields again.

Grandma went to visit one of our uncles, Ntxoov Vaj Thoj, who lived in zos Thas Nyav, about an hour’s walk away. He gave us a field not too far from the village—a small plot of land we could prepare and burn for planting.

We went to clear the field, chopping, cutting, and gathering the brush. When it was finally ready to burn, we returned home, tired but grateful.

Even with new surroundings, our daily duties stayed the same. Uncle Chong Neng and I took care of the goats, and I still had to watch over Xeng Doua and Nomfue, along with helping Grandma and the aunts with the family’s chores day by day.

Not long after, we went back to our old village to collect our rice. We carried it across hills and streams and stored it in our new little house—built of bamboo—on a small raised spot of land.

That same year, sickness came again. Hlob Npliaj Npis, Txiv Ntxawm Ntxoov Xeeb, and many of our elders passed away. We went to their village and gathered the rice they had left behind, carrying it to our new bamboo house.

We had one large basket—about five feet across and six feet tall—and we filled it with all the rice we could gather. At night, Aunt Mos, Aunt Iab, and the three of us—Uncle Chong Neng, Xeng Doua, and I—slept on top of that basket, the smell of rice and bamboo all around us.

We never stopped setting our traps. It was our only way to find meat—our small measure of strength and comfort. Sometimes we took Uncle Kneng Ze, sometimes even Nomfue, and together we went into the woods, setting and checking traps, laughing in the quiet moments between hunger and hope.

Those nights, the sound of bamboo creaking beneath us was our lullaby. We were poor, but we were together.

Poverty teaches you what truly matters.
A roof of bamboo, a bowl of rice, a family breathing beside you— these are the treasures the world cannot steal.
