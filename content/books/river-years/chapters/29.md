### Summary: This chapter captures one of the most intense turning points in your memoir — the moment where war, exhaustion, and survival all meet. You can feel Grandma’s weariness, her soul heavy from loss and running. Yet even as the world burns again, your family’s instinct to survive never dies.

### Chapter Narrative

After we finished seeding the rice, the monsoon rains began — late June into July of 1978. The clouds were heavy, and the wind carried the sound of thunder far beyond the mountains.

Then the war started again.

This time it was bigger than before.
They came from every direction — soldiers with rifles and cannons, with AKs and 105mm guns.
The sky itself shook.

Grandma refused to move. She sat by the doorway, her face calm but filled with sorrow.
She said quietly, “I am tired of running. I am sick of this war. We are only poor widows and orphans. The enemy will not waste their bullets on us.”

Her plan was to surrender.

But Uncle Tswv Nploog argued with her, saying we must flee with the others. The sound of gunfire grew closer, echoing through the valley like thunder cracking the earth. Still, Grandma did not move.

Then, two men ran past our house, shouting,
“The enemy is close! We saw them — they’re almost here! Move now! If you want to surrender, surrender later — but not here!”

Only then did Grandma rise.
She gathered her shawl, her voice trembling as she told us to pack what we could.
We moved quickly in the darkness, the rain still falling.

It was close to midnight when we left.
We walked through mud and tall grass, our clothes soaked and heavy. The children cried softly, but no one spoke.

We kept walking until daylight.
When the sun finally rose, we caught up with our relatives — Laug Ntsuab Pov and the others — who had fled before us.
We had escaped once more, but we knew the war had not finished with us yet.

There comes a time when even courage feels like exhaustion.
But love still pushes our feet forward, even when the road is made of mud and fear.
