Summary

In the midst of war, we fled once again—this time to the opium fields and mountain villages.
We harvested rice, learned to set traps, and found small joys in the wild.
Even as fear surrounded us, life continued to move forward.

Chapter Narrative: Two months after we returned from Heemhawj, around September 1975, Tojxeem Xaiv Suav Yaj had been summoned twice to attend a government seminar, and the third call was only days away. Knowing what was coming, he gathered all the men who still remained and called them to rise against the Laotian government—to become what people would later call Cob Fab.

When the fighting began, we escaped to our first opium field, Teb Yeeb Phamloosxuas. All the families from Ban Nabmub fled in different directions, searching for a place they believed would be safe.

We stayed in the field for almost a month before moving to Ban Najxoj (Roob Kub Nyhiab), where Uncle Ntxoov Yias Vwj and his relatives lived. When we arrived, it was rice harvest season—and also the time of a funeral for Uncle Ntxoov Yias Vwj’s aunt. Because of the ceremony, we spent two nights in the woods near the edge of the village before finally being invited to their home.

Uncle and Aunt Ntxoov Yias Vwj treated us like family. We helped them harvest rice, carry bundles, and share meals as if we had always belonged there.

At this village, my cousin Ntxawg Vwj (Aunt Chai Chur Vwj’s son), Uncle Chong Neng, and I began learning to set mouse traps in the woods. Every morning, while the elders worked in the rice fields, we woke up eager and ran to check our traps. Sometimes we even dreamed about them at night—the thrill of finding a catch waiting in the dawn mist.

Nomfue was still small, so we brought along Uncle Kneng Ze and Xeng Doua each morning to help us gather the mice. We’d return home, clean them carefully, roast them over the fire, and eat together. It was a small joy in a season of running—a reminder that even when the world was falling apart, children still found wonder in simple things.

Reflection

War scattered us like seeds in the wind,
yet in every place we landed, life began again.
Even in hunger, even in fear,
children still dreamed of morning.
