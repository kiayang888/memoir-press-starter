### Chapter Narrative

Soon after our immigration paperwork was complete, they loaded us onto a bus bound for Camp Noomqhais. But when we arrived, we were instead sent to Camp Kauthaus.

Camp Kauthaus was like a prison. A tall picket fence enclosed the entire area so that we could not see the outside world. The camp covered only about one or two acres, with rough shelters built around the perimeter. At the entrance stood the guard’s office and a flagpole before it.

Every morning at eight o’clock and every evening before sunset, a trumpet sounded—the call to raise and lower the Thai flag. Everyone, no matter how tired or weak, was required to stand and salute. If anyone failed to stand, the guards walked over and beat them—hard.

We arrived around noon. Uncle Tswv Nploog and tijlaug Txawj Lwm already knew we would be sent there, so they came to see us and brought food. We decided that Nomfue would go with them to stay temporarily in Camp Noomqhais until we could be transferred to Ban Vinai. We paid someone to sneak him through the fence, and that night he went with them safely.
