I was too young to remember the full shape of my father’s face. The details blur—his eyes, his smile, the way his mustache framed his lips. But what I do remember are fragments: the sound of his footsteps moving quickly, the way he never raised his voice, the quiet strength he carried as if it were his shadow.

I remember the smell of bitter meat he once saved for me, a small piece of thigh from the animal he had hunted and shared with our grandparents. I remember him hurrying through the fields, even in pain, carrying my younger brother on his back. I remember his last words, spoken not for himself, but for us: “Take care of the children. Do not separate them.”

Those words became the compass of my life. They carried us through hunger, through grief, through the lonely years of being orphans. They carried us when respect was lost after my mother remarried. They carried us when all we had was rice, meat, and the love of Grandma and our aunts to keep us alive.

This book is not just about my father’s passing. It is about what he left behind: lessons of quiet strength, family loyalty, and faith that even in the darkest storms, we are not abandoned. It is also about the resilience of children who learned to plant, to feed, to carry, and to survive when the world expected us to fall.

I write this because I do not want his story—or our story—to be forgotten. My father’s face may fade in memory, but his footsteps, his words, and his love still guide me. And now, I pass them on to you.
