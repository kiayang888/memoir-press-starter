Prologue:
A Prologue will give your readers an emotional doorway into the book. It lets you speak as your present-day self, looking back at your father’s life, your childhood, and why this story matters.

I was too young to remember the full shape of my father’s face. The details blur—his eyes, his smile, the way his mustache framed his lips. But what I do remember are fragments: the sound of his footsteps moving quickly, the way he never raised his voice, the quiet strength he carried as if it were his shadow.

I remember the smell of bitter meat he once saved for me, a small piece of thigh from the animal he had hunted and shared with our grandparents. I remember him hurrying through the fields, even in pain, carrying my younger brother on his back. I remember his last words, spoken not for himself, but for us: “Take care of the children. Do not separate them.”

Those words became the compass of my life. They carried us through hunger, through grief, through the lonely years of being orphans. They carried us when respect was lost after my mother remarried. They carried us when all we had was rice, meat, and the love of Grandma and our aunts to keep us alive.

This book is not just about my father’s passing. It is about what he left behind: lessons of quiet strength, family loyalty, and faith that even in the darkest storms, we are not abandoned. It is also about the resilience of children who learned to plant, to feed, to carry, and to survive when the world expected us to fall.

I write this because I do not want his story—or our story—to be forgotten. My father’s face may fade in memory, but his footsteps, his words, and his love still guide me. And now, I pass them on to you.

Epilogue – What My Father Left Me

“A child walks farther on the road of love than on the road of fear.” – Hmong proverb

Summary: Not all faces can be remembered, but the lessons remain—stay together, choose learning, work hard, protect the smallest ones, and keep faith.

I may not remember my father’s face clearly, but I remember his speed, his quiet strength, his last request that we never be separated. I remember the taste of bitter meat he saved for me, the creak of cabin beams, the feel of stones under bare feet. I remember how Grandma and our aunts took us in and stitched us together with rice, meat, and love.

Reflection:
My father taught me that the strongest men speak softly, carry their children first, and leave behind a path of love. I am still walking it.

Author’s Note:
This is not only the story of my father’s passing, but also of how love, loss, and survival shaped a generation. Many Hmong families lived these stories in silence. By writing, I hope to honor the memory of those who came before us, and to give voice to the children who were once left with only rice, meat, and love to sustain them.

Dedication:
To my father, whose quiet footsteps I still hear,
and to Grandma, whose hands fed and carried us when the world was heavy.
This book is for every orphan who ever longed for rice, meat, and love—
may you know you are never forgotten.

Acknowledgments:
I am grateful to the people whose memories, stories, and compassion helped shape this book:

To Grandma, who carried more than her share and wrapped us in love when we had nothing else.

To Aunt Nyiaj Vws, Aunt Mab, and Aunt Mos, who became mothers to us when our own mother could not.

To my brothers and sisters, who carried each other through hunger, fear, and grief.

To my uncles Lisfoom, Chongneng, and Knengze, who worked beside me and taught me that hard work and education could open new doors.

To my friends and fellow orphans, who knew the same hunger, the same tears, and who helped me see that survival was not just about food, but about hope.

Most of all, I thank the Lord, who guided my footsteps when I walked alone.

Back Cover Blurb:

The Father I Remember is the true story of love, loss, and survival in a time of war.

In the mountains of Laos in the early 1970s, a young boy watches his father work with quiet strength and endless devotion. His father is swift in step, gentle in voice, and steadfast in family duty. But when a tragic accident in the opium fields shatters their lives, the boy must learn to walk the road of orphanhood with his brothers and sisters.

Through hunger, separation, and the loss of respect after his mother’s remarriage, the children cling to the three essentials their father knew mattered most: rice, meat, and love. Guided by their grandmother’s care and their father’s last words—“Take care of the children. Do not separate them”—they find ways to survive, to learn, and to hope.

Told with raw honesty and deep faith, this memoir is more than a story of one family. It is a tribute to every orphan who has ever longed for the simple gifts of food, care, and love. And it is a son’s attempt to keep his father’s footsteps alive, even when the face has faded from memory.

“When war, hunger, and grief threatened to tear us apart, my father’s words kept us together.”

Author Bio / Lus Piav Txog Tus Sau
English

Charles CK Thao was born in Laos during a time of war and displacement. After losing his father at a young age, he was raised by his grandmother and aunts, alongside his brothers and sisters. Though orphanhood brought hardship, it also gave him resilience, creativity, and a deep love for family.

Today, he writes to preserve the untold stories of the Hmong people—stories of survival, faith, and love that carried a generation through war and exile. His hope is that younger generations will remember the footsteps of those who came before and walk their own paths with courage.
