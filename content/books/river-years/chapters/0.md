Prologue:

Don't Separate Us is a true story of love, loss, and survival in a time of war.

In the mountains of Laos in the early 1970s, a young boy watches his father work with quiet strength and endless devotion. His father is swift in step, gentle in voice, and steadfast in family duty. But when a tragic accident in the opium fields shatters their lives, the boy must learn to walk the road of orphanhood with his brothers and sisters.

Through hunger, separation, and the loss of respect after his mother’s remarriage, the children cling to the three essentials their father knew mattered most: rice, meat, and love. Guided by their grandmother’s care and their father’s last words—*“Take care of the children. Do not separate them”*—they find ways to survive, to learn, and to hope.

Told with raw honesty and deep faith, this memoir is more than a story of one family. It is a tribute to every orphan who has ever longed for the simple gifts of food, care, and love. And it is a son’s attempt to keep his father’s footsteps alive, even when the face has faded from memory.

## Author Bio 

Charles CK Thao was born in Laos during a time of war and displacement. After losing his father at a young age, he was raised by his grandmother and aunts, alongside his brothers and sisters. Though orphanhood brought hardship, it also gave him resilience, creativity, and a deep love for family.

Today, he writes to preserve the untold stories of the Hmong people—stories of survival, faith, and love that carried a generation through war and exile. His hope is that younger generations will remember the footsteps of those who came before and walk their own paths with courage.
