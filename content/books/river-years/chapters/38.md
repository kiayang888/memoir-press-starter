Chapter Narrative

Our first morning in Thailand, we wandered near the police chief’s house, which stood beside the courtyard. His wife came out carrying a child. She pointed at me and asked if I wanted to exchange my silver npib for Thai baht. I told her no. From Kiaj Mus Nas until that very moment, I hadn’t even realized I had those coins—five small silver pieces, about the size of dimes—tucked in the pocket of my white shirt.

Back in the courtyard, tijlaug Ntsuab Pov announced he was going to the market and could buy things for anyone who needed them. I handed him my coins. “Buy whatever you think we need,” I said. He returned with a rice pot and a few essentials for our family.

We also reunited with Grandma and aunt Lisfoom there in Npooskas. That first morning, our hearts were full: we had crossed the Mekong and stood, alive, on the soil of a democracy. Yet the joy was braided with anger and grief. Some people were wild with it—ready to fight.

Yawg laus Tooj Ntxawg Xyooj’s family—tijlaug Ntsuab Pov’s aunt and uncle (his aunt being hlob Vam Teev’s sister)—had been wealthy. All four had carried silver all the way from Kiaj Mus Nas, guarded it as they crossed the Mekong… and then watched it slide out of their hands like a bad dream. Now they were as poor as the rest of us. We all had just one pair of pants to cover our backsides and a shirt for our chests. It was poverty down to the bone.

Grandma had buried her silver at the riverbank—she’d dug a hole in the sand to hide it, as many did, for fear of robbers. That morning they asked the authorities for permission to go back and retrieve their money. When they got there, every cache had already been dug up and taken. People quaj tsis los kua muag—so devastated even tears would not come. It felt like we had been reborn into orphanhood again, all of us—except aunt Lisfoom and uncle Xaiv Neeb Muas, who still had a little to carry them.

Yawg laus Tooj Ntxawg Xyooj’s family suffered the greatest loss. Furious, he blamed tijlaug Ntsuab Pov and even tried to press a case with the authorities, but then left for Noomqhais.
