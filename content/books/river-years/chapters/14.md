Summary:
Early in 1975, I said farewell to an uncle who gave me a blanket as a final gift. Later, my mother asked us to carry loads of papayas for her daughter-in-law. These memories remind me of both the burdens of being an orphan and the unexpected gifts of love and strength.

In early 1975, my mother told me Uncle Kao (Vam Meej Vwj) was moving to Nabhiab and wanted to see me one last time. Together we visited him in Long Cheng. Before leaving, he gave me a green blanket as a keepsake.

Later that spring, a teacher asked us to carry his belongings to my mother’s village. Afterward, we stayed the night at her house. The next morning, my mother, stepdaughter, and daughter-in-law went to sell papayas in Phavkheb. She told them, “These boys are orphans and strong—let them carry your load.” And so we did.

The load was heavy, but by God’s grace, much of the fruit sold before we reached the market. We shopped, then returned home.

Reflection:
Saying goodbye to my uncle and carrying the heavy papayas for my mother’s family reminded me of the burden of being an orphan. Yet even in that, I found gratitude. The blanket my uncle gave me was more than just cloth—it was a symbol of love and memory. And the heavy loads I carried became reminders that God gives us strength when our bodies feel weak.
