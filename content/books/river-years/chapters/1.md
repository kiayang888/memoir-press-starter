Summary: A portrait of my father—his loyalty to family, his quiet nature, and the way he moved through life with speed and purpose.

Chapter Narrative: My father was a man of fierce devotion—to his brothers and sisters, his parents, and his uncles and aunts. He was always moving, always quick; if you walked with him, you had to hurry to keep up. Unlike me and Uncle Lisfoom, his voice was never loud or harsh. He spoke softly, like Xeng Doua and Nomfue—never threatening, never disrespectful, never discouraging. He wore a mustache, worked hard, and gave himself to family and labor.

Before the world changed, before war found our valley, I remember my txiv (father) as a man who walked quickly—as if life itself waited just ahead. To stay beside him, you had to move fast. His steps were light but sure, and I always had to half-run to keep up.

He loved his tsev neeg (family)—his brothers and sisters, parents, uncles, and aunts. His love showed not in words but in the way he worked, in the way he carried himself, and in how he treated people. My father never raised his voice. He was not loud or harsh like some men in the village. His tone was soft, calm—like wind moving through the bamboo forest at dusk.

When he spoke, people listened because his words were steady and kind. He never insulted or discouraged anyone. I can still see the small smile beneath his mustache, the quiet pride in his eyes when he returned from the fields carrying wood on his shoulders or tools in his hands. He believed that to provide was to love, and to love was to serve.

I learned early that gentleness is not weakness. My father’s quiet ways held a strength that did not need to shout. Love, when true, is steady—and it keeps pace even when the world is racing.
