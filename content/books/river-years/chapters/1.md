Summary: A portrait of my father—his loyalty to family, his quiet nature, and the way he moved through life with speed and purpose.

My father was a man of fierce devotion—to his brothers and sisters, his parents, and his uncles and aunts. He was always moving, always quick; if you walked with him, you had to hurry to keep up. Unlike me and Uncle Lisfoom, his voice was never loud or harsh. He spoke softly, like Xeng Doua and Nomfue—never threatening, never disrespectful, never discouraging. He wore a mustache, worked hard, and gave himself to family and labor.

Reflection:
I learned early that gentleness is not weakness. My father’s quiet ways held a strength that did not need to shout. Love, when true, is steady—and it keeps pace even when the world is racing.
