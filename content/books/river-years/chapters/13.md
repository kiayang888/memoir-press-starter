### Summary: While life at home was full of work and survival, school brought its own struggles. Arriving late after morning chores often meant harsh punishments that tested our endurance. These experiences taught me both the hardship and value of education.

### Chapter Narrative: 
Between 1973–1975, I went to school with Uncle Blong, Uncle Chong Neng, and Uncle Kneng Ze. Before class, we always had chores—collecting charcoal, grinding corn, feeding pigs. Sometimes these made us late, and at school punishment was harsh.

If late, we ran around the school ten times. Worse, we were forced to kneel on gravel, a six-foot ruler in our mouths, arms stretched along it for half an hour in front of the class.

Our teachers were Mr. Kiab, a Laotian, and Teacher Viblais Voos, known as Yawg Laus Nyiaj Vws.

The punishments at school were painful, yet they also taught me discipline. I learned that life would not always be fair, and that hard work at home might lead to hardship elsewhere. Still, even in those difficult lessons, I carried hope—because I knew that education was a path forward, even if the journey was hard.
