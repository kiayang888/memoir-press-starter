Summary
This section carries deep emotion — the intersection between innocence, superstition, and loss.  It’s one of the most haunting parts of your memoir: a single bird, a childhood rule broken, and a death that follows — the kind of story families whisper for generations.

Chapter Narrative

One morning, we went to check our bird traps.
When we reached one of them, the trap had been triggered, but it caught nothing.
We laughed and said to each other,
“Aub, txhais lawm tabsis tsis mag — it snapped, but nothing was caught.”

I reset the trap, but nearby I noticed a wild vine called ntsuag sas hmab, which could be eaten.
I climbed up on its stump to cut some, and when I looked down, I saw something — a small bird lying still on the ground, not far from the trap.

I shouted to Uncle Chong Neng, pointing my finger,
“The bird! It’s dead — over there!”

He came and picked it up. The bird was small, its feathers still warm from the sun.
Uncle Chong Neng began plucking it carefully. He loved to cook, even if there was only a little to share.
There were many of us, but he roasted it anyway, crushed it with a bit of hot pepper, and made enough for us to taste.

But there was a rule we all knew:
If something wasn’t caught in a trap or hunted properly, we shouldn’t take it. We shouldn’t eat what the spirits did not give.

By the time the bird was cooked, Grandma and Uncle Tswv Nploog were not home.
We waited for them to return and asked if we could eat it.
They told us no — it wasn’t right.
But I’ve always wondered if Uncle Chong Neng tasted a little of it while he was cooking.

Not long after that, Uncle Chong Neng got sick. His illness grew worse every day until he could no longer walk.

Some people said his spirit had been taken — that when Ntxawm Leej Hlob passed away, he helped bury her and accidentally slipped into her grave, and that’s when his soul left him.
Others said it was the bird — that we had broken a taboo.

I didn’t understand it then, but later Aunt Nyiaj Vws told me that Txiv Ntxawm Paj Huas said the same thing — his spirit was lost that day.

When Uncle Chong Neng passed, we buried him beside Txiv Ntxawm Ntxoov Xeeb Thoj (Hlau’s father) — two good men resting together under the same soil.

Reflection

In every life, there are moments we don’t understand until years later.
Some lessons come through words;
others, through loss.
And sometimes, the spirits teach in silence.
