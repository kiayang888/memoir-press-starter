### Summary:This chapter is one of the most emotionally tender and symbolic moments in the story: children walking through loss and longing to find their mother again. We walked for hours beneath the sun to find our mother in Tiaj Nyujqus. Four small children, following hope through fear and dust. When Xeng Doua cried, the door opened— and love met us again in silence.

### Chapter Narrative

Many months passed before we heard any news of Mother again. We had been home for only a few days when Niam Hlob Vamteev came to see us. She said, “Choj, I met your mother. She has settled in zos Tiaj Nyujqus. She told me that if you children miss her, you can go visit.”

The rice weeding was done, and it wasn’t yet time to prepare the opium fields, so I asked Grandma if we could go. She looked at me quietly and said, “Go—go see her, and see how she loves you.”

The next morning, Jude and I took Xeng Doua and little Nomfue and started the long walk. It was about three to four hours away. I already knew the way to zos Tiaj Nyujqus and also knew an aunt and uncle who lived there—phauj thiab yawg laus Neeb Muas (Tsav Txhiaj Muas)—the couple who had sponsored my parents’ wedding.

We passed zos Nabyees, followed the winding trail through Tiajnpleg, and crossed the river Nabyees. Along the way, I caught a small crayfish, tied it with a vine, and gave it to Nomfue to carry. 

When we turned to look back, we could see our father’s old opium field—Teb Yeeb Hav Tuamyuj—shimmering faintly under the sun. Overcame with emotions, Jude and I began to speak softly, almost singing, “Ua licas nim tshav ntuj nrig es menyuam ntsuag tsis muaj niam tsis muaj txiv es menyuam ntsuag yuav tuaj nrhiav niam nrhiav txiv nrog txoj kev ua dab ua tsov luag.” (How bright the sun shines, yet we orphans—with no mother and no father—walk this road searching for them among spirits and strangers.)

We both cried tears falling without end. When we looked around, we saw snakes slithering everywhere through the grass. Frightened, we screamed and ran uphill, hearts pounding until the ground leveled again near the edge of zos Tiaj Nyujqus.

We didn’t know which house was our mother’s, but I recognized Aunt Tsav Txhiaj Muas’s home. We stopped there and asked, “Do you know where Nom Maiv Lis lives?” She pointed with her finger and said, “Her house is over there.”

Excited, we ran down the hill and came near the house. At the edge of the yard we stopped. We were afraid—not of punishment, but of rejection. I asked Jude to knock on the door, but she refused. I asked Xeng Doua, and he didn’t want to either. Finally, I dragged him toward it; he resisted, so I tapped his head with my knuckle and he began to cry loudly.  

Inside, my mother heard his cry. She opened the door and saw us standing there—four children who had walked miles to find her. She let us in, and we stayed with her for about a week before returning home.

There are journeys that lead us home, and others that show how far from home we already are. That day, under the bright Laotian sun, four orphans carried both love and loss in our small hands— the memory of a father who built with silence, and the ache of a mother we could no longer fully reach.
