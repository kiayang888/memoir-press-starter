Summary
This chapter captures a haunting and powerful transition — the uneasy calm after surrender, where the line between survival and scavenging blurs. It’s a time when war has emptied villages, leaving ghosts, silence, and hunger.
Your memory of searching for a simple pair of scissors amid ruins — and of naming new horses in the middle of chaos — gives this passage both sorrow and grace.

Chapter Narrative

After our surrender, we were told to move to another village — the one where the enemy had set up their camp. That place was called zos Tiaj Nyom Loj.

We spent the night there, and in the morning, they ordered us to go back to our old village, zos Tiaj Nyom Me — the one near the airstrip, hauv Tshav Nyoobhoom.

When we returned home, the village was quiet. We stayed there for almost a month.

We were able to gather our goats and chickens again, though many were gone. Some had turned wild, scattered into the hills. The villages nearby were all abandoned — ghost villages. No laughter, no smoke, no life.

We went from house to house, looking for things that could still be used. I remember searching every room, not for food or clothes, but for one simple thing — a pair of scissors.
And I found one.

After some time, we moved again — this time to zos Pham Xuvmuv, the village where Tijlaug Teev Thoj’s grandparents had lived. It was the last stop — the end of the road, where no more livestock could pass.

There, we decided to butcher our cow and sell the meat. But before anyone could buy, the enemy began firing again — heavy 105mm shells raining down on us.

Everyone ran for their lives.
No one stopped to buy meat.

The sun was setting, and the shells still came, landing closer and closer. I took charge, leading the younger ones down the hill to a cave near the edge of the village.
Grandma, Uncle Tswv Nploog, and another uncle worked together to carry what meat they could and followed us down to safety.

We stayed in that cave for nearly a week.
Most of the group agreed we should surrender again — they were tired, hungry, and done with running.
But Tijlaug Ntsuab Pov and Uncle Tswv Nploog decided otherwise.
They planned to flee.

They left their wives and children with us, trusting we would surrender safely while they disappeared into the forest.

While waiting, Uncle Kneng Ze and I went from house to house with Grandma, Niam Tij Kaus Yias, and Ntxawm Ntxoov Xeeb Yau. We searched for anything useful — and again, I was still looking for scissors. I remember the joy of finding one in the corner of a dusty old house.

By now, many of the animals left behind had gone wild — chickens, goats, pigs, even horses. They were hard to catch.
So Uncle Kneng Ze made a bow and arrows, and we hunted chickens for lunch.

At the far end of the road, people had abandoned many animals before fleeing. There we found two horses — one gray and one red-black. The next day, we went back again and caught two more, a brother and sister.

We named them Npoj Liab and Maum Liab.

At that point, we had four horses.
We gave the red-black one to Txiv Ntxawm Txooj Xyoob (Nai Xaim Vaj Thoj) and kept the other three for ourselves.

Hlob Vam Teev’s family had two places to live — one in Kiaj Mus Nas (Vam Leej Zos) — and sometimes they shared their supplies and stories with us.

The world was quieter now, but it was not peace.
It was only what was left when everything else was gone.

Reflection

Sometimes survival feels like wandering through the ruins of your own life.
Yet even there, amid ashes and silence,
we still searched for simple things — scissors, hope, and a reason to keep going.
