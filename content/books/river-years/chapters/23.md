Short Summary

This is a powerful passage — a bridge between sorrow and endurance, showing how the pain of loss turned into quiet perseverance and strange, haunting nights. It carries both physical hardship and spiritual fear. The rains came, and Jude grew sick. We had no food, no medicine—only faith. By the time I returned with the shaman’s tools, she was gone. We buried her by the creek, beneath the weeping sky.

Chapter Narrative

The monsoon arrived with heavy rain, and it was time to weed the rice fields again. Aunt Mos, Aunt Iab, and my sister Jude were in charge of working the field closest to the village.

But one day, all three of them became sick at the same time. Each had a fever that came and went, hot in the day and cold at night. For three days, they lay weak, sweating and shivering.

It was a hard time. There wasn’t enough food for the family, nor enough strength to care for everyone. Because of that, Jude couldn't get the attention or care she needed.

On the afternoon of the third day, Hlob Txiaj Xab Lauj and his wife came to visit. The moment they entered the house, Jude’s fever grew worse. Her body shook with cramps—her arms and legs tightening until she cried out for help.

Grandma and Niam Hlob Txiaj Xab rushed to her side, massaging her limbs, whispering words of comfort. Hlob Txiaj Xab turned to me and said,
“Go quickly, borrow Hlob Faiv Ntaj Thoj’s shaman instruments. I will call for her soul.”

I ran as fast as I could. The rain was still falling, and the mud clung to my legs as I crossed the yard. It was only about fifty yards to Hlob Faiv Ntaj’s house. I grabbed the instruments and raced back—
but when I returned, Jude was gone.

Her small body lay still. The sound of the rain seemed to stop.

We began her funeral that same moment. There was no rice, no salt, no offerings to give—only what we had. Grandma dressed her in one of her old Hmong outfits. It was too big for Jude, so Grandma used a needle to stitch it smaller, wrapping it gently around her.

We killed one pig for the ceremony, and used muas thij—ground wild yam—in place of rice. Her funeral lasted one night and half a day. We buried her on the other side of the hill, across the small creek where we fetched water every day.

After Jude was laid to rest, Aunt Mos and Aunt Iab slowly began to recover. The fevers lifted, and the house grew quiet again.

Life went on. I cared for Xeng Doua, for Nomfue, for the goats. I dug wild yams again, the same earth that had kept us alive now holding the sister I had lost.

Loss comes quietly, like the rain that never stops.
We keep working, keep surviving, and carry the names of those we love in every handful of earth we touch.
