Summary

This chapter is one of the most powerful and haunting scenes in your memoir — a moment of surrender, of realizing that survival sometimes means walking toward the enemy instead of away. You capture the quiet tension of waiting, the simple act of raising a white flag, and the sorrow of leaving animals and home behind.

Chapter Narrative

Before the war broke out, we had butchered our sow and sold the meat to the villagers.
Grandma and Uncle Tswv Nploog joined with other uncles and together bought two cows to slaughter and sell as well. We hired one butcher, and most of the meat sold quickly — people were hungry, and times were hard.

But soon after, the war came again.
There was no time to finish the work.
We were forced to flee, taking one cow with us and leaving the goats and chickens behind.

That night, we reached the caves in the hills.
We waited for the fighting to pass, for safety to return.
By morning, we believed the others had fled far enough to be safe.

We cooked a simple breakfast and sat together, silent, tired, hearts heavy with what was coming next.
Grandma said that since there was nowhere left to run, it was time to surrender — to give ourselves to the soldiers and pray for mercy.

We decided to wait for the enemy to arrive at the village, so that we could walk from the cave and meet them there peacefully.
But we waited and waited, and no soldiers came.

So Niam Tij Kaus Yias and Niam Ntxawm Ntxoov Xeeb volunteered to go first.
They carried a piece of white cloth — our only flag — and went down the hill to raise it high over the village, a sign that we were ready to surrender.

We watched from the distance as they lifted the flag into the air.

Not long after, we saw the soldiers coming — rows of them, their steps steady and heavy.
But these were not Laotian soldiers.
They were Vietnamese, and only one Laotian man came with them — a translator, speaking their words for us.

We stood on the path between the cave and the village, our small group of orphans and widows, faces covered in dirt, hands shaking but open.
We had nothing left to give but our surrender.

Reflection

Surrender is not the end of courage.
Sometimes it is the only way the living can keep living.
And even as we lowered our heads,
our hearts still prayed for tomorrow.
