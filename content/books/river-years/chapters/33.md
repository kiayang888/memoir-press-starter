Chapter Narrative

After surrendering to the Laotian government at Kiaj Mus Nas / zos Noomnawm (Vam Leej Zos), we finally had salt to cook with—but still no sugar and no clothes. Grandma bought me a pair of military boots—wonderful to me then. Most government “household duties” fell on me, often alongside yawg Txhiaj Xeeb Thoj (father of txiv Nyiaj Pov and txiv Xauv Mas). Once, we headed toward Moos Cab to buy salt. Midway, we met two relatives from the Xiong family. They said they had just bought the last salt there. Yawg Txhiaj Xeeb asked, “If that’s so, we’re completely out—could we carry yours for you? Whatever amount you give us, we’d be grateful.” They agreed. Each of us carried a sack of their sea salt home. I craved salt so badly that I ate handfuls of the raw crystals along the way. At their house, they gave us about 10 pounds each.

In the dry season of 1979 (late January or early February), I went with txiv Nyiaj Pov, yawg laus Nom Neeb, and others to lom ntse (poison fish) far downstream near Thoj Thoos Thoj Vias. We traveled all day and made tsev pheebsuab (leaf shelters) by the river. That night, no one could urinate near or even face the water, and everyone spoke in whispers. At dawn, the elders used Mazuka mine powder to poison the river: they lit it, let it flare, then plunged it into the water. The river boiled with smoke; wherever bubbles drifted, fish and creatures died. I was slow on the rocky shore—barefoot—so I gathered less than the others, but enough to carry home and share.

That year, most of Tswv Nploog’s family prepared to flee to Thailand while we did what we could. When we first moved to Vam Leej Zos, many rice barns sat abandoned out in the fields. Hlob Vam Teev led us to bring that rice back to feed the families. Relatives of those who fled accused us of stealing and reported us. Hlob Vam Teev went alone to defend us; the case was dismissed.

Two months before our planned departure, txiv Nab (Nyiaj Yaj) and txiv Nai Xaim Vaj (Txooj Xyoob) were arrested and sent to “seminar” (re-education). That is why yawg Tshuas Ntuj and some relatives remained in Laos much longer. We heard tijlaug Ntsuab Pov had returned from Thailand—soon, we would leave.

We prepared rice and supplies. I didn’t understand the costs or dangers of crossing the Mekong then; I was only excited. Grandma bought me new military shoes—green, brand new.
