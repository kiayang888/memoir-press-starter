### Chapter Narrative

When our names were finally called, we learned that our transfer had been approved. Uncle Tswv Nploog brought Nomfue back to join us, and early the next morning we boarded another bus.

The ride to Ban Vinai lasted nearly all day. We passed villages, open fields, and hills, feeling both nervous and hopeful. None of us knew what kind of life awaited us next—but we knew we were finally leaving the fence behind.

When the bus stopped, we stepped out into Ban Vinai Refugee Camp, Thailand.

Our new home was registered as:
Camp 6, Subdivision 4, House 16, Room 4, Ban Vinai, Thailand
(Xoom 6, Khub 4, Asqhas 16, Hoob 4, Npab Vidnais, Thailand.)

#### Reflection:
Even behind fences, people dream of open sky. Camp Kauthaus was a place of hunger, sickness, and humiliation—but also a waiting place between bondage and freedom. Every trumpet that ordered us to salute the flag reminded us that we still belonged to no country, but our hearts already faced the horizon.
