### Chapter Narrative

The night we crossed, we lost one grandfather—txiv ntxawm Tooj Tuam Thoj’s father, the very man who had helped Grandma cross. Several families—yawg Txhiaj Xeeb’s, yawg Nom Lwm’s, and others—were captured by Laotian soldiers and taken to Pajxas. Tijlaug Ntsuab Pov and the men pooled what they had, paid Thai boatmen, and slipped across the river by night to rescue them. By the second or third night, they had brought them back.

Almost every morning, new groups crossed and joined us. We lay about that courtyard like a herd of goats. If it didn’t rain, people slept in the open. If it did, everyone crowded shoulder-to-shoulder beneath the government porch—goats under a narrow roof.

#### Reflection: Freedom sometimes begins with a mouthful of cold rice, a coin you forgot you had, and a place to sleep on a concrete porch. We learned that survival is a braid—of mercy, loss, and stubborn hope.
