  "description": "This book is a story of survival, love, and memory. It is about my father, who died too young, and about the words he left us: “Take care of my children. Do not separate them.” It is about life as orphans during a time of war, when hunger, fear, and abandonment tested us. It is about the bonds of siblings who became parents to each other, and about the love of a grandmother and aunts who kept us together when the world turned away. I write this story so that my children and grandchildren will know where they came from, and so that my father’s memory will live on. Though I do not remember his face clearly, I remember his footsteps, his love, and his legacy. This book is for him.",
