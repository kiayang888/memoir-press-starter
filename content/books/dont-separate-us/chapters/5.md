Years later, I returned to Laos. On that journey, I was blessed to be accompanied by Uncle Tooj Leej Thoj. He shared with me stories I had never known—how my father and his brothers and sisters grew up as orphans after their mother, my grandmother, passed away.

My father was the eldest, the one who carried the burden of raising his younger siblings. He knew the pain of hunger and the loneliness of being without parents. He understood that life as an orphan was harsh and unforgiving. That is why, with his final breath, he begged that we not be separated. He wanted us to remain together, to find strength in one another.

Hearing these stories, I understood him in a new way. His life had been marked by struggle from the beginning, yet he chose love, responsibility, and family.

As I grew older, I realized how deeply his words had shaped my life. “Do not separate them.” Those words carried us through hunger, war, and abandonment. They carried us through nights of fear and days of labor. They carried us when respect was lost, when we had no shoes, when we shared spoons at mealtimes.

Even now, I do not remember his face clearly. But I remember his footsteps, his strength, and his love. And I know that his legacy lives on through us—through the bonds we refused to break, through the love we gave each other, through the survival we earned together.

The Father’s Legacy (Poetic Reflection)

I returned to Laos,
and I learned what I had always known in my heart:
my father had been an orphan too.

The eldest son,
he carried his siblings on his back.
He endured hunger, loss, loneliness.
And because of that,
he left us his final command:
“Take care of my children. Do not separate them.”

Those words became our inheritance.
They carried us through the storms,
through hunger and fear,
through days without shoes,
through nights with only one spoon to share.

I do not remember his face.
But I remember his footsteps.
I remember the bitter taste of the meat he saved for me.
I remember the cabin roof, the rain, the silence of his suffering.

His legacy is not land,
not wealth, not possessions.
It is love.
It is survival.
It is the truth that family must stay together.

And so we did.
And so we will.
