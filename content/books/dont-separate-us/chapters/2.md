My father died in September 1972, just weeks after my brother Nomfue was born. The rains poured so heavily that we could not carry him to a hospital. We buried him beside the road, along the path we walked each day to the fields. His grave lay near the dry creek and the airstrip, a place where our footsteps would forever pass.

In the days that followed, grief was heavy but bearable. We still carried half the respect of the community. We were fatherless, but we were not yet alone.

But then came my mother’s remarriage. That was a wound deeper than death. When she remarried, the respect we once carried vanished. We were no longer seen as children under a father’s name. The world looked at us differently. Only our grandmother, our aunts, and our uncle Lisfoom wrapped us in love and care. They made the decision to raise the eleven of us who were left as orphans, holding us together so that my father’s last words would not be broken.

It was not an easy life. We had little, but we had each other. We shared spoons at mealtimes, three children using one spoon, taking turns with quiet manners. We learned to yield, to bow our heads, to live with respect even in hunger.

In those years, I discovered a truth I have carried all my life: for orphans, there are three things more important than anything else—rice, meat, and love. Only parents can truly give these. When orphans see other children with them, they stare longingly, unable to look away. Hunger is not just for food—it is for love.
