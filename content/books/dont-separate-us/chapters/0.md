## Dedication

For my father, whose last words—*“Do not separate them”*—kept us together and gave us strength. For my grandmother, my aunts, and my siblings, who carried me when life was too heavy. And for my children and grandchildren, so they will never forget the roots that made them strong.

## Acknowledgments

I wish to thank my grandmother and aunts, who raised us with love when we had no parents. I thank my uncles, who gave us guidance and sent us to school. I thank my brothers and sisters, who carried me through grief and hunger. And I thank God, for giving us the strength to endure.

## Introduction

This book is a story of survival, love, and memory. It is about my father, who died too young, and about the words he left us: *“Take care of my children. Do not separate them.”*

It is about life as orphans during a time of war, when hunger, fear, and abandonment tested us. It is about the bonds of siblings who became parents to each other, and about the love of a grandmother and aunts who kept us together when the world turned away.

I write this story so that my children and grandchildren will know where they came from, and so that my father’s memory will live on. Though I do not remember his face clearly, I remember his footsteps, his love, and his legacy. This book is for him.
