After my father passed, Uncle Lisfoom stepped in to care for us. He sent us to school, honoring the decision I had made to study instead of following my mother to the fields. It was a gift that changed my life.

At school, I discovered my talents. I could draw well, and I could sing. These skills helped me earn good grades, and they became my way of shining in a world that often felt dim.

But the hardest part was when teachers assigned projects. Other children had fathers to help gather supplies and tools. We did not. We were orphans, and the burden of schoolwork weighed heavy on us.

Yet we were not alone. My uncles—Txoov Neeb (Chongneng) and Neej Zeb—stood by me. I also had friends, brothers in orphanhood, who understood the struggle because they lived it too. Together, we went to the forest to cut bamboo and wood. We worked as a team, creating projects with our own hands. Often, our work turned out better than the other children’s, because hardship had taught us patience, skill, and determination.

Through these struggles, I learned something important: if I set my mind and my hands to a task, I could do it—and I could do it well.

Even so, my heart longed for something more. If I had a chance, I would have chosen time with my father over all the achievements. To this day, I cannot remember the details of his face. His image is lost to me, but the lessons of survival he left behind remain.
