After my father passed, Uncle Lisfoom stepped in to care for us. He sent us to school, honoring the decision I had made to study instead of following my mother to the fields. It was a gift that changed my life.

At school, I discovered my talents. I could draw well, and I could sing. These skills helped me earn good grades, and they became my way of shining in a world that often felt dim.

But the hardest part was when teachers assigned projects. Other children had fathers to help gather supplies and tools. We did not. We were orphans, and the burden of schoolwork weighed heavy on us.

Yet we were not alone. My uncles—Txoov Neeb (Chongneng) and Neej Zeb—stood by me. I also had friends, brothers in orphanhood, who understood the struggle because they lived it too. Together, we went to the forest to cut bamboo and wood. We worked as a team, creating projects with our own hands. Often, our work turned out better than the other children’s, because hardship had taught us patience, skill, and determination.

Through these struggles, I learned something important: if I set my mind and my hands to a task, I could do it—and I could do it well.

Even so, my heart longed for something more. If I had a chance, I would have chosen time with my father over all the achievements. To this day, I cannot remember the details of his face. His image is lost to me, but the lessons of survival he left behind remain.

Lessons of the Orphan Years (Poetic Version)

We went to school without a father’s hands.
When projects came, we had no one to help.
But we had each other.

We went to the forest,
cutting bamboo, carrying wood,
building with our bare hands.
What we created was strong,
sometimes stronger than the work of those with fathers.

Hardship taught us patience.
Hardship taught us skill.
Hardship taught us that together,
we could survive.

I sang to earn my grades.
I drew pictures to make teachers smile.
Even in hunger, I found beauty.
Even in sorrow, I found music.

I learned this truth:
Anything my hands touched,
anything my mind set itself upon,
could be done—and done well.

But deep inside, I wished for something else.
If I could trade all my talent, all my strength,
it would be for one more day with my father.
Just to see his face.
Just to remember him as he truly was.
