My father was a man of quiet strength. He did not shout, threaten, or belittle. His love for his family—his brothers and sisters, his parents, his uncles and aunts—was his compass. He walked quickly, so quickly that to stay with him you had to hurry. His mustache framed a gentle face, and he carried himself with dignity.

In 1970, illness swept through our family. My father grew sick, and so did my sister Jude, my brother Xeng Doua, and I. We traveled first to Long Cheng, and when no cure was found, to Vientiane. I remember arriving in the dark of night. My mother, Xeng Doua, and I were separated from my father and Jude. By morning, my mother killed a hen, cooked rice, and we searched for them. Along the road, a relative recognized us and led us back together.

By 1971, the war had reached Long Cheng. We fled to Roob Tauj, then moved to Ban Nabmou. My father longed for the old days—farming rice and opium, working with the soil. He wanted stability for us, a life rooted in the land.

But fate was unkind. In 1972, while finishing the roof of a cabin in the opium fields, he lifted wood from a pit and his hernia ruptured. That evening, I saw him walk quickly past me, silent but determined, carrying my little brother on his back. By the time night fell, his pain had overtaken him.

The rains came heavy and hard, rivers flooding the paths, making it impossible to move him. For days he suffered. Finally, weak and knowing the end was near, he spoke his last words to my grandmother and aunt:
“Take care of my children. Do not separate them.”

He died in September of 1972, just one month after my brother Nomfue was born. We buried him by the road we walked to our fields, between the dry creek and the airstrip. I was too young to remember the details of his face, but I will never forget his footsteps, his love, and the ache of his absence.

The Father’s Footsteps (Poetic Version)

He walked quickly, always ahead, as if life itself was chasing him.
To keep up with him was to learn that time never waits.

His voice was never harsh, never loud.
He did not threaten, did not curse.
He built with his hands, and loved with quiet strength.

In 1972, the rains came and would not stop.
The pit filled with wood, and his body broke beneath its weight.
I saw him pass me, silent, carrying my brother on his back.
By night, he lay in pain. By dawn, he had no words left.

His last request was simple, but eternal:
“Take care of my children. Do not separate them.”

He had been an orphan himself. He knew the pain of being scattered.
He asked only that we remain together.
That we never lose each other to grief, to war, to life.

I do not remember his face.
But I remember the sound of his footsteps,
the bitter taste of squirrel meat he saved for me,
the way the rain beat down on the cabin roof.

Sometimes memory is only fragments.
But fragments are enough.
Fragments hold love.
