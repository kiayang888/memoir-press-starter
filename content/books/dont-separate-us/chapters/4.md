After my father’s death and my mother’s remarriage, life became even more uncertain. But in the emptiness left behind, a new strength grew—our bond as siblings.

Grandmother, Aunt Nyiaj Vws, and Aunt Mab wrapped us in love, raising the eleven of us who had been left as orphans. They made sure we had rice to eat, fields to tend, and a home to return to. Without them, we would have been scattered.

Grandmother was strong but tender. She chewed rice and fed it to baby Nomfue when no one else could. She reassigned roles to us as if she were the general of a small army of children. Jude, though only seven or eight, was told to care for baby Nomfue. I was given Xeng Doua. Together, Jude and I did everything side by side. We carried the younger ones on our backs, took them with us to the fields, and made sure no one was left behind.

We were children ourselves, but we became parents to each other. We cooked, fetched water, watched over one another at night, and endured the long hours of labor in the fields.

There were times of fear too—like when our aunts were left alone in the wild rice fields during monsoon nights. But no matter how hard life became, we carried on because we had each other.

I learned then that the ones who truly love you are your parents, your brothers, and your sisters. Beyond that, it is only the immediate family who will stand by you. This truth became the foundation of my life.

The Bonds That Kept Us (Poetic Reflection)

After Father was gone,
after Mother remarried,
we were not alone.

Grandmother wrapped us in her arms.
Aunt Nyiaj Vws and Aunt Mab stood like trees,
strong, rooted, sheltering us.
They chose to raise eleven orphans as their own.

Jude, just a child, carried Nomfue.
I carried Xeng Doua.
We carried each other.
We walked with little ones on our backs,
hands too small, hearts too big.

We learned to cook, to fetch water,
to sleep in the dark without fear.
We learned to yield, to share, to endure.

Children raising children.
Brothers and sisters becoming parents.

And I learned this truth:
The ones who love you most—
your mother, your father, your brothers, your sisters.
No one else can give the same love.

It is a love of blood,
a love that survives hunger and war,
a love that does not break.
