Southbound

We began our journey south on Sunday, November 22, 2025, the kind of morning that carries both anticipation and quiet ache. We packed the car carefully, each item a small declaration that winter would not find us here this year. We were headed to our condo in Sebring, joining the slow migration of snowbirds who chase warmth when the days grow thin and cold.

Before we could leave, we had one last stop to make.

We met our children to say goodbye, lingering longer than planned, as if delaying departure could stretch the moment. Our grandson Miles was asleep when we arrived, but Leja and Mitchell went to wake him so we could hold him one more time. He is our pride and joy, the kind of love that settles deep and permanent. We kissed his soft cheeks, took pictures we would look at too often, and carried the sweetness with us as we drove away.

Before heading out, I called Auntie and Uncle Nyia Vue to thank them. The night before, my husband had stopped by their house, and they had packed lunch for us—an act so familiar in our family it almost goes unnoticed, except it shouldn’t. That kind of care follows you down the road.

The first day took us nine long hours, ending in Paducah, where we stayed at a La Quinta. We traveled with Popper, our little dog, and the hotel welcomed him for a small fee, which felt like a small mercy after such a long drive. There was, however, one setback: the boat cover my husband had bought had torn apart somewhere along the way. He stopped, bought a tarp, and secured it tightly, making sure nothing we packed inside the boat would be lost to wind or chance. Travel always finds a way to test you early.

The next morning, I called my older sister Ying to let her know we were still hours away and wouldn’t arrive until evening. Instead of stopping early, we decided to push through and drive all the way to Suwanee to stay with her. I was excited in a way that surprised me—she lives far from everyone, and time rarely grants us these visits.

We stopped at Golden Corral for lunch. The food wasn’t what it used to be before COVID, but we ate anyway, grateful for a place to rest our legs. By around 7 p.m., we finally arrived. I rushed toward the door, saw my sister standing in the kitchen with a soft smile, and—true to form—ran straight past her to the bathroom. Some things never change.

That night, she took us to a Korean BBQ restaurant. The waitress was young and warm, grilling pork belly and ribeye right at the table. Side dishes filled the table—kimchi, fermented beans, sauces layered with history and heat. The food was excellent, though I couldn’t eat much after a day of snacking and buffet indulgence. What mattered more was being together. We sat in her living room afterward, talking past midnight, stories unfolding easily, as if time had been holding them just for us.

The next morning, my sister woke before dawn and began cooking breakfast. We were nearly ready to leave when the rain came down hard, steady and insistent. So we sat and ate instead, talking a little more. Being with her felt grounding. There is a particular comfort in sisterhood—a shared language of memory and understanding that requires no effort.

As we were finally preparing to leave, she stopped us. She said she had something to give us. From her hands, she placed into mine her prized xav chaws—a silver necklace she loved—and pressed some cash into my husband’s hand. That is who she is, always thinking of others, always giving. I felt my chest tighten. No one had ever given me something so precious, not since my mother. I felt guilty accepting it, knowing how much she cherished those things, but she reassured me that it was given in love.

In that moment, I realized how rare it is to feel loved so purely, so deliberately. I nearly cried. We said our goodbyes by the boat, the rain softening the edges of the morning. I felt the sadness of leaving her, knowing she would soon be heading north to see her own children in North Carolina.

That day, we drove another four and a half hours and stopped in Lake City for the night, once again at a La Quinta.

On the third day, we continued south, determined to reach Sebring before dark. We still had to deal with the boat. At the villa, boats weren’t allowed to park, so we unloaded everything and drove the boat to our land in Wauchula. It was one last task before settling in, a reminder that even arrival requires effort.

But we were close now. Winter would pass somewhere warmer. And the road behind us—full of love, family, and small acts of care—had already done its quiet work on my heart.
