Life in Sebring (November 2025 – May 2026)

We bought a small two-bedroom condo in Sebring, Florida, about forty-five minutes from our land in Wauchula. It became our winter home, a place to slow down while the colder months passed elsewhere. In December, after the frost came through, we learned that all our fruit plants and passion fruit vines in Wauchula had not survived. We had tried to cover them, hoping to save what we could, but the cold was unforgiving. The loss was quiet but heavy. We had imagined planting again and harvesting fruit the following year, and it hurt to let that hope go.

Still, Sebring offered its own kind of healing. The weather was usually kind—cooler nights here and there, but always sun-filled days. During lunch breaks or after work, we took walks, letting the warmth soak into us. I loved walking past the big oak trees, watching their branches sway gently as sunlight filtered through the leaves. There was something grounding about those moments, a peace that settled deep in my chest. Even the sunsets felt generous—the orange glow pulling memories from long ago, filling me with a soft nostalgia I couldn’t quite name.

On weekends, we tried to explore. Sometimes that meant driving to Tampa to stock up on Asian groceries, other times it was simply wandering nearby towns, letting curiosity lead the way. Life moved at a slower pace, and I welcomed it.

In January, our son Lawrence came to visit for a week. We picked him up from the Tampa airport on a Saturday, and the joy I felt seeing him was immediate and full. He had found a job and was now living on his own in New Jersey—a fact that still felt unreal to me. The very next day, he cooked us a roast beef. It was perfectly done, timed just right, and I was amazed watching him move confidently in the kitchen. We finished the meal with wine, sitting together, savoring more than just the food.

During the week, he and his dad went fishing and hunting together, sharing time the way men often do—side by side, unspoken but meaningful. On his last day with us, we drove to Okeechobee, took a walk, and then went out to a seafood restaurant. Lawrence treated us to dinner. He ordered a platter with frog legs, alligator, and turtle. I hesitated at the turtle but eventually tried it—it was chewy, unfamiliar. I ordered steak, his dad chose a fish sandwich, and Lawrence had a fish fry. Sitting there, watching him care for us, I felt a swell of pride so strong it almost caught me off guard. I had raised a thoughtful, capable man.

The next morning, we woke at 3 a.m. to take him back to the airport in Tampa. After dropping him off, we spent the day driving around the city, stopping at nurseries, letting the hours pass gently. These are the moments that linger—the ordinary ones that later feel rare.

Time has moved faster than I ever expected. My son is grown now, living his own life, no longer under our roof. When I think back to when my children were young, I wish I had known how quickly those days would disappear. I would have held them longer, paused more often, memorized their laughter better. I hope they know, even now, how deeply and endlessly they are loved.
