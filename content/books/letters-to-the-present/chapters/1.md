## The Father’s Footsteps  

He walked quickly, always ahead, as if life itself was chasing him.
To keep up with him was to learn that time never waits.

His voice was never harsh, never loud.
He did not threaten, did not curse.
He built with his hands, and loved with quiet strength.

In 1972, the rains came and would not stop.
The pit filled with wood, and his body broke beneath its weight.
I saw him pass me, silent, carrying my brother on his back.
By night, he lay in pain. By dawn, he had no words left.

His last request was simple, but eternal:
“Take care of my children. Do not separate them.”

He had been an orphan himself. He knew the pain of being scattered.
He asked only that we remain together.
That we never lose each other to grief, to war, to life.

I do not remember his face.
But I remember the sound of his footsteps,
the bitter taste of squirrel meat he saved for me,
the way the rain beat down on the cabin roof.

Sometimes memory is only fragments.
But fragments are enough.
Fragments hold love.

## The Difference Between Death and Abandonment 

When my father died, it was sad, but it was not the saddest thing.
He left us with respect, with dignity, with his last words to stay together.
Even in death, he still held us.

But when my mother remarried, the respect fell away.
That was worse than death.
The world looked at us differently.
We were orphans, but also abandoned.

Only grandmother, only our aunts, only Uncle Lisfoom
wrapped us in their arms,
and made the choice to keep us whole.
Because of them, we were not scattered.

I remember sharing spoons—three children, one spoon.
Taking turns, careful not to touch,
careful to keep our manners.

I remember the truth I learned as an orphan:
Children hunger for three things—
rice, meat, and love.
Without parents, these are the hardest to find.

Hunger for food can be endured.
But hunger for love leaves the deepest scar.

## Lessons of the Orphan Years 

We went to school without a father’s hands.
When projects came, we had no one to help.
But we had each other.

We went to the forest,
cutting bamboo, carrying wood,
building with our bare hands.
What we created was strong,
sometimes stronger than the work of those with fathers.

Hardship taught us patience.
Hardship taught us skill.
Hardship taught us that together,
we could survive.

I sang to earn my grades.
I drew pictures to make teachers smile.
Even in hunger, I found beauty.
Even in sorrow, I found music.

I learned this truth:
Anything my hands touched,
anything my mind set itself upon,
could be done—and done well.

But deep inside, I wished for something else.
If I could trade all my talent, all my strength,
it would be for one more day with my father.
Just to see his face.
Just to remember him as he truly was.

## The Bonds That Kept Us  

After Father was gone,
after Mother remarried,
we were not alone.

Grandmother wrapped us in her arms.
Aunt Nyiaj Vws and Aunt Mab stood like trees,
strong, rooted, sheltering us.
They chose to raise eleven orphans as their own.

Jude, just a child, carried Nomfue.
I carried Xeng Doua.
We carried each other.
We walked with little ones on our backs,
hands too small, hearts too big.

We learned to cook, to fetch water,
to sleep in the dark without fear.
We learned to yield, to share, to endure.

Children raising children.
Brothers and sisters becoming parents.

And I learned this truth:
The ones who love you most—
your mother, your father, your brothers, your sisters.
No one else can give the same love.

It is a love of blood,
a love that survives hunger and war,
a love that does not break.

## The Father’s Legacy  

I returned to Laos,
and I learned what I had always known in my heart:
my father had been an orphan too.

The eldest son,
he carried his siblings on his back.
He endured hunger, loss, loneliness.
And because of that,
he left us his final command:
“Take care of my children. Do not separate them.”

Those words became our inheritance.
They carried us through the storms,
through hunger and fear,
through days without shoes,
through nights with only one spoon to share.

I do not remember his face.
But I remember his footsteps.
I remember the bitter taste of the meat he saved for me.
I remember the cabin roof, the rain, the silence of his suffering.

His legacy is not land,
not wealth, not possessions.
It is love.
It is survival.
It is the truth that family must stay together.

And so we did.
And so we will.
