Chapter 1 — My Father

My father was one of those men who was very passionate toward his brothers and sisters, his parents, and all his uncles and aunts. He was very active and quick in everything he did. When he walked, you had to keep up to stay beside him.

As I remember, he did not have a loud or harsh voice like me and my uncle Lisfoom. He was quiet like Xeng Doua and Nomfue. He never threatened anyone, said bad things, or disrespected or discouraged people. He had a mustache and was very dedicated to his family and his work.

Thematic Reflection:
My father taught me that strength doesn’t need to shout. He showed that a man’s true power is found in patience, humility, and devotion to family. Even now, I walk faster, as if trying to catch up to him still.

Chapter 2 — When We Became Sick (1970)

In 1970 my father became sick, along with my sister Jude, Xeng Doua, and me. We had to fly to Long Cheng to be cured, but we could not, so we flew to Vientiane instead. When we arrived it was already dark. They separated my mother, me, and Xeng Doua from Jude and my father.

Early in the morning my mother killed a hen and cooked rice so we could eat. We went out to look for my father and Jude. On the way our uncle Vam Meej Vue caught up to us and led us to them. Because there were many relatives staying with them, my mother and Xeng Doua had to fly to Long Cheng and leave Jude and my father behind.

A month later they came to Long Cheng. I do not remember much about Jude’s hair, but I remember that my father’s hair was gone because he had too many lice.

Thematic Reflection:
Illness taught us that life can separate a family in an instant. But love finds its way through distance and pain—it is the one thing that sickness cannot divide.

Chapter 3 — When War Broke Out (1971)

In 1971 the war broke out in Long Cheng, and we fled to Roob Tauj. My father and grandmother wanted to live life as in the old days, when people could grow opium and rice freely. So we moved again, this time to Ban Nabmou.

Thematic Reflection:
War does not just destroy homes; it uproots the sense of peace within. But as long as family stays together, even a mountain village can become a place of hope.

Chapter 4 — The Opium Field and the Accident (1972)

In August 1972 my youngest brother, Nomfue, was born. A month or two later, we went to our opium field at Teb Yeeb Avdaj. My father’s plan for this trip was to finish building the roof of the cabin at the field.

That same day when we arrived, he began cutting wood and splitting it into shingles to cover the roof. There was a rocky pit near the cabin, and as he worked, the wood pieces began to fall into it. The pit soon became too crowded for him to move. He tried to pick up the pieces and lift them up to the surface to make more room.

At that moment, his hernia broke, and he was in great pain. I do not know how long he had been hurting, but around five or six in the evening, my sister Jude and I saw him walk quickly past us toward my mother, who was feeding baby Nomfue with Xeng Doua beside her. I saw him put Xeng Doua on his back and start walking toward the first opium field—the way home. My mother called for Jude and me to get things ready, and we followed him down, but we could not catch up.

When we reached the first field’s cabin, he handed the baby to Grandma and laid down on the bed. He was in too much pain to speak. We stayed there through the night. In the morning, my mother and all of us went home, leaving my father and Grandma behind at the cabin.

Because it was raining so hard, our relatives could not come to help carry him back to the village. We waited one or two days before we could move him. When we finally brought him home, we knew he could not be cured and needed to go to Long Cheng, but the rain poured like a running river for a week.

My father’s last words were spoken to Grandma and Aunt Nyiaj Vws. He asked them to please take care of us four children and not to separate us.

Thematic Reflection:
In that storm, his last strength was not used to save himself, but to carry us. His final words became the thread that held us together—the promise that love must never be divided, even when life is.

Chapter 5 — The Days After His Passing (1972)

My father’s life had been that of an orphan, the oldest brother who took care of everyone else. He knew that staying together was better because we could help one another, just as he had helped his sister, Aunt Nyiaj Vws. The life of orphans was always hard and full of suffering.

If there had been another chance, I would have wanted to spend more time with my father. But it is too bad that I don’t even remember how he looked or how much he did for us before he passed away.

During the year he died, around August, my mother was still in confinement after giving birth to Nomfue. I remember going with my father to build the first opium-field cabin. One evening he took me hunting squirrels. I kept making noise with my lips, and he told me to stop. Another time, after he finished the first cabin, he started building the second—where he was later injured. He would go in the morning and come back to sleep at the first cabin in the evening.

Grandma and Aunt Nyiaj Vws still worked the old opium field. My father loved setting traps and hunting. He once caught two nploos and cooked them, inviting all the grandparents and neighbors who were working nearby to join him. He saved one piece of the thigh meat for me—it tasted bitter, but I was proud.

At that time we had no shoes; we walked barefoot on rocks, through bushes and trees, in every season of the year. I was proud because everyone called me Me Ab Choj! I never imagined that later people would call me Choj Nplog, Choj Ntswg Ntsuab, or Choj Quajtaug. After a few months, those new names began, and people looked at me differently.

In those days, the most important things for children—especially orphans—were rice, meat, and love. These three things only parents could give. When orphans saw another child who had them, they would stare in silence until someone pulled them away. I was thankful that Grandma and Aunt Nyiaj Vws took care of us and that we took care of each other.

My father passed away around September 1972, shortly after Nomfue was about one month old. The monsoon rains had turned dry creeks into rivers, and we could not airlift him to the hospital. He was sick for about a week before he died. They buried him beside the road we traveled to our opium fields, between the dry creek running from Rooj Majmum and the airstrip. They even dug part of the trail for his grave.

For three mornings, my mother and I did the ritual of farewell. The first morning, we went all the way to the grave; the second, halfway; and the third, to the fire pit. At lunch that same day, we called him and the others who had passed to join us. There were three family members gone, and when we used three spoons for them, we had no extra spoons left for ourselves. Sometimes three people had to share one spoon and take turns eating, careful not to cross hands or bump into each other. Grandma reminded us to always mind our manners.

Thematic Reflection:
The days after his death taught me that grief does not end with the burial. It becomes part of daily life—shared spoons, silent prayers, and the empty space where a father’s voice used to be.

Chapter 6 — After Father Was Gone (1973–1974)

After my father passed away, my mother, baby Nomfue, and I went back to the first opium field to prepare for planting rice. My mother could not do much. She walked back and forth, crying while holding Nomfue, who was also crying on my back. Finally, I decided not to help her in the field anymore but to go to school instead. I told her my decision, and from that day, I only helped in the fields on weekends.

After my father died, Uncle Lisfoom came to take care of us and sent us to school as I had wanted. I was good at art, drawing, and singing, which helped me get good grades. The hardest part was when we were given school projects. We had no father to help us, but Uncle Txoov Neeb (Chong Neng) and Uncle Knehg Tze (Neej Zeb) were with me. We had other friends and brothers who were also orphans. We helped each other by going to the woods to cut bamboo and wood so that we could finish our projects well, sometimes even better than others.

In my life, I learned that anything I set my mind and hands to could be done perfectly.

Thematic Reflection:
Losing a father pushed me to grow faster than my age. School became my new field to tend, and every small success was a way to honor the strength he left in me.

Chapter 7 — The Lao Water Festival (April 1973)

During the Lao Water Festival, which was in April 1973, Grandma, my mother, Aunt Nyiaj Vws, and Aunt Txhiaj Cua went to get rice from Vajfoom village. Grandma asked me and Uncle Chong Neng to follow them and wait on the mountain between Huab Khib Nees and Tsu Anoo Groov.

Early that morning, they left. Around 8 a.m., Uncle Chong Neng, Uncle Kneng Ze, and I followed and waited on the mountain where Grandma told us to meet them. We waited all day, but they never returned. When the sun was about to set, we were too afraid to go home because there was a graveyard on the way.

I remembered the way to Grandma and Grandpa Shoua Ying Vue’s house over Roob Huab Kib. I led us down the hill to the dusty road, and we walked until dark. Uncle Kneng Ze was scared of cars, so whenever one came, he ran off the road and almost fell into the ditch.

When we arrived, it was hard to see, but Grandpa and Grandma recognized me. We stayed there for three days and four nights. We did many silly things with Uncle Ma, my mother’s younger brother. On the early morning of the fourth day, we left for home.

When we climbed up the mountain and came down into the valley near a small stream, a place where travelers stopped to eat lunch, I heard a voice calling from my left side. It was my mother’s voice—“Ab Choj! Ab Choj! Where have you been?”

I turned and saw my mother with a group of men. She was carrying baby Nomfue on her back, and they were eating their wedding lunch.

We went to them. My mother cried a little, and my stepfather came to us. He gave me some money, though I can’t remember how much, and also gave some to my uncles. They shared their lunch with us, and that was when I realized my mother had remarried.

After we finished eating, they told us to go home because Grandma and Uncle Lisfoom were worried. On the way back, we met them near Houakineng village. Uncle Lisfoom yelled, “Where have you carried your bones to? Don’t you know we were worried?” I told him everything.

When my father died, it was sad—but when my mother remarried, that sadness cut deeper. After Father’s death, people still gave us some respect. But after her remarriage, we lost all respect, except from our immediate family—Grandma, Uncle Lisfoom, and Aunt Ma. Grandma and Aunt Ma wrapped us in love and care and made the good decision to raise the eleven of us orphans together.

Thematic Reflection:
A father’s death takes away your shelter; a mother’s remarriage takes away your place beneath it. Yet love from those who remain becomes a new kind of roof, built from kindness and pain.

Chapter 8 — Preparing the Rice Fields (May 1973)

When May came, Uncle Lisfoom led us to prepare a rice field with our cousins down the River Nabmub. Grandma was out of her mind with grief and went to stay with her relatives at Nabhiab for about a month.

The time to plant rice came. All us boys were in school, and only Aunt Mab and Aunt Mos went with the cousins to plant the rice. They stayed many days until the cousins finished and left, leaving the two of them alone at the plain wild rice field. Aunt Mab told me later that they were very scared at night. The nights were long and lonely, but they stayed until the field was done.

The monsoon season began, and we heard that my mother was being mistreated by her new husband. She went to live with Uncle Kaub Vue (Dablaug Vam Meej Vwj) in Long Cheng and sent word for Grandma to bring baby Nomfue home because he had rashes all over his body. We also heard he had drunk gasoline because my mother could no longer focus on life.

The stepfather didn’t like Nomfue and didn’t want my mother to raise him. We hadn’t given him to my mother permanently—we had only asked her to nurse him until he could eat solid food.

In August 1973, Grandma went to bring Nomfue home. He was almost a year old but looked like a six-month-old because of malnutrition. When we saw him, he was skinny, covered with rashes, and crying. Everyone ran to comfort him. Grandma chewed rice and fed it to him from her mouth, and soon everyone did the same. He cried at night, hungry and missing our mother, but his rashes healed and he began to grow again.

Grandma assigned Jude to care for Nomfue even though she was only seven or eight years old. I cared for Xeng Doua. We all cared for one another. Jude and I always worked together and took the younger ones with us, except when we had to carry heavy loads or go far. The ones who truly love you are your parents, brothers, and sisters—your immediate family.

Thematic Reflection:
When the world rejects you, family becomes your only refuge. Even children learn to be parents when love is all that keeps a family alive.

Chapter 9 — Life Under Grandma’s Care (Late 1973 – 1974)

After the monsoon ended and the New Year Festival approached, Grandma told me again to visit my mom and ask for new clothes and shoes. Every year she said the same.

At that time, it was the opium-farm season, like autumn here. The vegetables were plentiful for market, so Aunt Mab and other aunts—like Niam Hlob Vam Teev—took theirs to sell. I went with them to visit my mother.

I didn’t know which village or house was hers, but Niam Hlob Vam Teev knew a little. When we reached the village, she pointed to one house and said, “That’s your mother’s.”

I went there and knocked. My two stepsisters, Cho and Cha, opened the door. The house wasn’t finished yet. I stayed a few days, and my mother bought me clothes and shoes. When it was time to return home, no one from my village was passing by, so I had to travel alone.

My mother asked, “Do you remember the way home?”
I said, “Yes, but I’m scared. It’s two or three hours’ walk through the jungle.”
She told me, “Don’t be afraid. I’ll take you to the main trail, and people will be passing. Just walk with them.”

She walked me to the edge of the village and said, “Now you go alone. Don’t be afraid.”
I said goodbye and started walking.

I knew the way but felt afraid because I had to climb mountains and cross valleys—the same places where, once before, I met my mother when she was going to marry my stepfather. There were many travelers on the trail, but they were afraid of me. They thought I was a ghost because I walked alone—a boy of only nine or ten. They looked at me and hurried past without a word.

I made myself a pretend horse, a nees zaj, from a long stick. I dragged it on the ground so it bounced ahead of me, and it became my companion. Before long, I reached home safely.

When you are alone and afraid but know your path, have faith. The Lord will guide you through. He always will.

Thematic Reflection:
Even in loneliness, faith is the quiet hand that leads you home. A child’s courage can carry generations of memory.

Chapter 10 — Nights by the Fire (1974)

After my mother remarried, we children could not sleep in our parents’ old bedroom anymore.
We slept on the floor between Grandma’s and Aunt Mab’s beds, behind the fire pit.
Every night Grandma made our sleeping places, covering us with blankets.
We had no pillows—just folded clothes to rest our heads on.

Before we fell asleep, Grandma always told us one or two stories.
They were not real stories, but they were about orphans—about Ntsuag, Niam Tij, and Tijlaug—stories like Cinderella, where the orphans were mistreated but eventually found good lives.
After the story, Grandma checked on each of us to make sure we were covered and sleeping properly.
Only then did she go to bed herself.

Every morning Aunt Mab woke early to prepare breakfast.
She half-boiled the rice, then steamed it, just like she later taught us to do.
When we felt the heat from the fire and smelled the rice cooking, we got up and gathered around the fire pit—without washing our faces or hands, just hungry and waiting for mov vwm (soft boiled rice).
She made each of us one ball of rice and handed it out while she continued cooking.

We were many: Choj, Nruas, Ntsum, Iab, Maum, Txoov Neeb, Suav, and Pov Fwm Yej.
Pov Fwm Yej was still a baby, so everyone chewed rice and fed him from their mouths.
When he grew old enough for Jude (Ntsum) to care for him, we began sleeping on the guest bed in the living area.
During the day, we cleared the bed for visitors and at night laid it out again.

Grandma divided us into groups of two, each with its own responsibilities.
Most of our duties were to soak rice in the evening for the next morning.
The older ones took care of the younger ones.
She always reminded us, “You might have enough not to die of hunger, but the little ones will die if you don’t feed them.”
We kept her words in our hearts and always made sure the younger ones ate before we did.

Thematic Reflection:
In a house full of loss, Grandma’s voice became our lullaby.
She taught us that love is not spoken loudly—it is served in small rice balls at dawn.

Chapter 11 — Working for Food (July 1974)

Grandma knew that children needed more than rice—they needed meat for strength and love for spirit.
She also knew that Uncle Nyiaj Nplaib had strong pigs and chickens that survived disease.
So she asked him if we could weed his rice field in exchange for one female pig and a few chickens to raise.
He agreed.

Aunt Mab led us early each morning to weed his fields.
We worked for a whole week until his field was clean, and then he gave us what Grandma had asked for.
Grandma gave one hen to Jude and baby Pov Fwm Yej and another to me and Doua.

That July, our hens began laying eggs and hatching chicks.
I heard that chicks grew healthier if their coop was dug into the ground, so I dug two holes near the kitchen and built shelters there.
It worked—the chicks grew fast and strong.
Every chick belonged to someone, and every part of each chicken was already reserved to eat.
I always claimed the head and said, “When Grandma kills your chicken, I want the head.”
Someone else would say, “Then I’ll take the drumsticks!”
We laughed about it, but it showed how much we valued even the smallest piece of food.

That year was a good year.
The chickens grew healthy, the pig had babies, and we didn’t have to stare at other people’s meals wishing for a taste.
Uncle Lisfoom also gave us four goats, and soon we had eight or nine.
Our orphan life was sad, but it was also good, full of work, laughter, and enough to share with others.

We were poor, but the Lord’s hands were upon us.
We had enough to feed our family and even to help others.
We killed a pig for the New Year festival and helped our uncles and aunts whenever they needed us.
Only our aunts-in-law sometimes complained that one or two chickens were never enough for our large family—because Grandma always saved the best pieces for the youngest ones.

Thematic Reflection:
Hard work gave us dignity.
Even without parents, we learned that a family can grow strong when love replaces wealth.

Chapter 12 — The Visit to My Mother (1976)

When the monsoon ended and the New Year festival came near, Grandma told me again to visit my mother and ask her to buy me clothes and shoes.
She always told me this before the school season or New Year came.

It was opium-farm season, like autumn here.
The vegetables were plentiful for market, so Aunt Mab and Niam Hlob Vam Teev took theirs to sell.
I went with them to visit my mother.
I didn’t know which village or which house was hers, but Niam Hlob Vam Teev knew a little.
When we reached the village, she pointed to one house and said, “That’s your mother’s.”

I went there.
The house was not yet finished.
I knocked on the door, and my two stepsisters, Cho and Cha, opened it for me.
I stayed with my mother for a couple of days, and she bought me a set of clothes and shoes.

When it was time to go home, no one from my village was passing by, so I had to go alone.
My mother asked, “Do you remember the way back?”
I said, “Yes, but I’m scared. It’s two to three hours through the jungle.”
She said, “Don’t be afraid. I’ll walk you to the main trail. There will be people passing—just walk with them.”

She walked me to the edge of the village and said, “Now you go by yourself. Don’t be afraid.”
I said goodbye and started walking.

I knew the way, but I was scared because I had to climb mountains and cross valleys—the same places where I once met her on her wedding day to my stepfather.
There were many people on the trail, but they were afraid of me.
They thought I was a ghost because I was walking alone, just a small boy.
They looked and passed quickly without a word.

To keep myself company, I made a pretend horse, a nees zaj, from a long stick.
I slid one end of it along the ground so it bounced ahead of me, and I followed it until I reached home.

When you are alone and afraid but know your path, have faith.
The Lord will guide you through—He always will.

Thematic Reflection:
Faith is the hand that leads a child through fear.
Even when love feels far away, courage lights the road home.

Chapter 13 — Lessons from Grandma (1974–1975)

During the years after my father’s death, Grandma became both our protector and our teacher.
She raised us with discipline, love, and a deep sense of responsibility.
She made sure we understood that even orphans had to be strong, polite, and respectful.

Every morning before sunrise, she told us to prepare ourselves for the day’s work.
She would say, “If you work hard, you will eat. If you are lazy, you will starve.”
Those words stayed with me all my life.

When I look back, I realize how much we learned without having much.
We learned to cook, to clean, to care for one another.
We learned that a family survives not through comfort but through unity.
There were nights when we had only a little rice, but Grandma always said,
“We share what we have, even if it’s just enough for one.”

Thematic Reflection:
From Grandma we learned that survival is not about strength alone—it’s about staying together.
Her love became the soil where our faith grew.

Chapter 14 — Jude’s Passing (1977)

After the harvest season of 1977, tragedy came again.
We were living in a small village near Phuv Laj, where Grandma, my uncles, and aunts were trying to build a new home.
We had little food and no salt or sugar.
Most of us were weak from hunger and the constant moving.

One day, Aunt Mos, Aunt Iab, and my sister Jude were assigned to weed the rice field close to the village.
That same day, all three became sick.
They had fevers that came and went, day and night, for three days.

On the afternoon of the third day, Hlob Txiaj Xab Lauj came to visit.
As soon as he and his wife entered the house, Jude’s fever worsened.
Her arms and legs cramped, and she cried out for help.
Grandma and Niam Hlob Txiaj Xab tried to massage her, and Hlob Txiaj Xab told me to borrow shaman instruments from Hlob Faiv Ntaj Thoj so he could perform a healing ritual.

I ran to get the instruments—about fifty yards away—but by the time I returned, Jude had passed away.
Her funeral began immediately.
We had no rice, no salt, and almost nothing to use for offerings.
Grandma dressed her in one of her own Hmong outfits, which was too big, so she pinned it to fit her small body.
We killed one pig and used muas thij (ground corn) as rice for the ceremony.
The funeral lasted one night and half a day.
We buried her across the small creek where we drank water every day.

After Jude’s passing, the two aunts slowly recovered.
The rest of us returned to our daily chores, though life felt emptier than before.
Jude had been the gentle heart of our family.
Even as a child, she carried her younger siblings with patience and care.
Losing her was like losing the morning light in our home.

Thematic Reflection:
When an orphan loses another orphan, the world feels twice as heavy.
But love does not end in the grave—it remains in every act of care the living continue to give.

Chapter 15 — Digging for Life (1977–1978)

After Jude passed away, we had nothing to eat but wild yams.
Grandma and Uncle Kneng Ze first tried to dig them, but they couldn’t find enough.
So I began to go into the forest alone, carrying my digging stick and basket every morning.
I learned how to find them—by the shape of the leaves and the softness of the ground.
Sometimes I dug all day just to find enough for dinner, breakfast, and lunch for our family of ten.

There were three types of wild yams: qos toj nqeeb, qos zoov, and qos daj nco.
The easiest to dig was qos toj nqeeb, but they were small and barely enough to fill one meal.
Sometimes I found one big root that could feed us for several days.
The holes I dug were often eight feet deep or more.
It was hard work, but it kept us alive.

I believed that God was with us then.
Only He could have hidden food deep in the ground for orphans like us to find.
Every yam I unearthed felt like a gift from heaven.
I whispered prayers of thanks, even when my arms ached and my feet were sore.

Thematic Reflection:
Faith and hunger walk side by side.
When all else is gone, even the smallest root becomes a blessing, and every breath of survival becomes a prayer.

Chapter 16 — Hard Times and Faith (1978)

Life continued to be hard after Jude’s passing.
Grandma was getting weaker, and the fields did not grow enough to feed us all.
The war had ruined much of the land, and people were leaving the mountains one by one.
Every few months, another family would disappear into the distance, heading toward safety.

We stayed as long as we could because Grandma did not want to leave the place where our father was buried.
She said, “If we move too far, his spirit will not find us.”
So we worked the small fields near the creek and gathered vegetables and wild herbs to survive.

Uncle Lisfoom and Aunt Mab went out often to trade and find food.
Sometimes they came back with dried meat or salt; other times, with nothing.
We learned to live on very little—boiled vegetables, small fish from the river, and rice stretched thin with water.

Thematic Reflection:
Faith is not only for days of peace; it is the fire that keeps you warm when everything else is gone.
In hunger and war, belief itself became our daily bread.

Chapter 17 — Fleas and Flight to Tiaj Nyom (1978)

When soldiers entered our village, we had to flee again.
There was shooting in the distance, and rumors spread that the enemy was coming closer.
We left in the middle of the night, carrying only a few blankets, a cooking pot, and the youngest children.
The goats and pigs were left behind; we never saw them again.

We walked for days through wet fields and thick forest until we reached Tiaj Nyom, where some relatives had gone before us.
We were exhausted, covered in dirt and flea bites.
The place was small and crowded, but we built a temporary hut from bamboo and grass.
It wasn’t much, but it gave us shade and a little peace after so much fear.

At Tiaj Nyom, we stayed for a while.
We dug for food, gathered wild fruit, and tried to plant small patches of rice.
Life was uncertain, but for the first time in a long while, the sound of gunfire faded behind the mountains.
Still, Grandma refused to unpack completely.
She said, “We must be ready to move again. The world has not yet settled.”

Thematic Reflection:
Sometimes survival means learning to live half-rooted, always ready to move.
Even in exile, family remains the only homeland that never disappears.

Chapter 18 - The Walk To Mother

After months of not hearing from mother, Niam Hlob Vamteev brought news that she’s living in zos Tiaj Nyujqus. I asked Grandma if we could go. She said, “Go—see her, and see how she loves you.”

The next morning, Jude and I took Xeng Doua and Nomfue and began the long walk—three or four hours across hills and rivers. Along the way, I caught a small crayfish and gave it to Nomfue to carry. When we looked back, our father’s old opium field shimmered in the sunlight.

Overcome with sadness, Jude and I cried and whispered:
“Ua licas nim tshav ntuj nrig es menyuam ntsuag tsis muaj niam tsis muaj txiv...”
(How bright the sun shines, yet we orphans—with no mother and no father—walk this road searching for them.) We cried until we saw snakes saw snakes slithering everywhere through the grass. Frightened, we screamed and ran uphill, until the ground leveled near the edge of zos Tiaj Nyujqus. 

We didn’t know which house was our mother’s so we asked Aunt Tsav Txhiaj Muas. She told us, “Her house is over there.” 

We walk towards the house and stopped close to the house. I asked Jude to knock on the door, but she refused. I asked Xeng Doua, and he didn’t want to either. Frustrated, I tapped his head with my knuckle and he began to cry loudly. 

Inside, my mother heard his cry. She opened the door and saw us standing there. She let us in, and we stayed with her for about a week before returning home.

Chapter 19 — Holding On (1979–1980)

By 1979, the war had finally quieted, but life was still difficult.
The older children worked in the fields while Grandma stayed home to care for the little ones.
I was now one of the oldest, and much of the responsibility fell on me.
Each morning I rose before the sun to fetch water and start the fire.
When I looked around at my brothers and sisters still sleeping, I remembered my father’s words:
“Take care of the children. Don’t separate them.”
Those words became my duty and my purpose.

Sometimes I wondered what my life would have been like if my father had lived.
Would I still have learned to work so hard?
Would I have understood the meaning of love as deeply as I did now?
I didn’t know.
But I did know that my father’s spirit lived through every small act of care, every meal shared, every prayer whispered before sleeping.

When I looked at my brothers and sisters, I felt both sadness and pride.
We had survived storms, hunger, and loss.
We had no wealth, no land, no power—but we still had one another.

Thematic Reflection:
The greatest inheritance a parent leaves behind is love that refuses to die.
Even in hardship, we carried that love like a torch through the dark.

Chapter 20 — The Last Journey (1980–1981)

As the years passed, the mountains grew quieter, but the silence was not peace—it was emptiness.
Many of our relatives had already fled across the Mekong River.
Stories came back to us about camps in Thailand, about safety, food, and a chance to begin again.
But for Grandma, leaving was not easy.
She still said, “This is where your father rests. If we leave, who will keep his spirit company?”

I was torn between loyalty and survival.
I knew Grandma’s heart was bound to the soil of our past, but my heart was already walking toward the horizon.
The war had taken too much—our father, Jude, our childhood, and the life we once knew.
All we wanted now was a future.

That final year, the rice harvest failed.
The rains were too heavy, and the fields drowned before the stalks could ripen.
We ate what we could find—roots, wild vegetables, and the last of our stored corn.
When even the goats began to die, Grandma finally looked at us and said, “It’s time.”

We packed only what we could carry: a few clothes, cooking pots, and a single blanket each.
The path out of the mountains was steep and muddy.
Each step felt like leaving a piece of ourselves behind.
We passed the old opium fields, the broken cabins, and the stream where we buried Jude.
We stopped there to pray one last time, whispering our goodbyes.
The water still ran softly through the valley, carrying our memories away.

Thematic Reflection:
Leaving home is never just a journey of the body—it is a tearing of the soul.
But sometimes, the road to safety begins where grief and courage meet.

Chapter 21 — Carrying the Past Forward

When we finally reached safety, life was not suddenly easy.
We were refugees—people without land, without a flag, and without a clear place to belong.
But we had each other, and that was enough to start again.
The camps were crowded, hot, and filled with stories of loss, but they were also filled with hope.
We met other families like ours, people who had crossed rivers and mountains just to live.

At night, when I lay awake listening to the murmurs of hundreds of strangers, I thought of my father.
I remembered how he walked—fast, determined, never wasting time.
I remembered Grandma’s voice by the fire, her stories of orphans who one day found peace.
And I realized that we had become those stories.
We were the children who had endured, who had not given up, who still loved even when the world had forgotten us.

Now, as I look back, I understand that everything my father taught—quiet strength, patience, and love—has lived on in us.
He told Grandma before he died, “Take care of my children. Do not separate them.”
Those words carried us through every loss, every journey, every night of hunger and fear.
We stayed together.
We survived.
And we learned that even the smallest light of love can guide a family through the darkest valley.

Thematic Reflection:
To remember is to honor.
Our story is not just one of loss, but of endurance—the kind of love that no war, famine, or time can destroy.
