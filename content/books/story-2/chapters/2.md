Preface — The Father I Remember

My father walked quickly, as if life itself could not wait. His hands built, his voice soothed, and his love guided quietly. In 1972, when rain swallowed the mountains and war swallowed our home, his final words became our compass: “Take care of the children. Do not separate them.”

This book is not just about loss—it is about how we stayed whole when the world fell apart.

Chapter 1 — The Journey to Long Cheng

1970–1971

When sickness struck our family, we were flown from our mountain home to Long Cheng, and then to Vientiane. I was a child, carried from one place to another, not understanding that the world was already at war. I remember my father’s quiet strength even as he grew weaker.

Reflection:
We remember strength not by its loudness, but by its gentleness. My father taught me that care and speed can coexist—that love does not need noise to be powerful.

Chapter 2 — The Field of Wood and Rain

Ban Nabmou — 1972

In the opium fields, my father worked to finish a cabin roof. The day was heavy with humidity and the smell of pine. He lifted one more beam, his body gave way, and pain took him. Rain trapped us in the mountains, and by the time we reached home, he could no longer be saved.

His last words to Grandma and Aunt Nyiaj Vws were simple: “Do not separate them.”

Reflection:
Some words outlive the body that speaks them. These became our inheritance—a will written not on paper, but in rain and sorrow.

Chapter 3 — The Orphan’s Promise

Late 1972–1973

After Father passed, Mother grieved until her tears became her language. I told her I would study instead of work the fields. Uncle Lisfoom honored my wish and sent us to school. There, I learned art, song, and survival. We had no father to guide our hands, so we built from what we had: friendship, bamboo, and faith.

Reflection:
Education was not escape—it was remembrance. Every word I learned was a step away from hunger and a step toward keeping Father’s promise.

Chapter 4 — When Mother Remarried

1973

I found out my mother had remarried when I saw her again on a mountain path. Her voice called my name, and beside her stood another man. I did not yet know the weight of that moment—that respect can vanish faster than love.

Grandma took us in and wrapped us with care. She fed us first, even when food was scarce, and taught us to feed the youngest before ourselves. She reminded us: compassion keeps a family alive longer than bread alone.

Reflection:
To lose a parent is pain; to lose belonging is a deeper hunger. But kindness, even from those not bound by blood, can rebuild what loss takes away.

Chapter 5 — Rice, Meat, and Love

Ban Nabmou — 1973–1974

We bartered labor for a sow and some hens. Our first piglets and chicks were wealth beyond gold. Grandma said: “You will not die if you miss a meal; the little ones might.”

We learned to share one spoon among three, to take turns with dignity, and to find pride in our small victories.

Reflection:
Poverty teaches gratitude. Every full belly was a prayer answered. Every grain of rice, an act of love.

Chapter 6 — The War Turns

Long Cheng → Roob Tuaj — 1975

When the communists came, the sky filled with planes and the ground with fear. We followed Uncle Lisfoom toward Thailand, only to turn back. The journey taught us that survival was not just about fleeing danger but staying together.

At night we whispered Father’s words: Do not separate them.

Reflection:
War is not only fought with guns. It is fought in the heart—between despair and devotion.

Chapter 7 — The Year of Hunger

Puvlaj — 1976–1977

We moved again, carrying goats, pigs, and the last of Grandma’s opium. Food vanished; salt became treasure. We dug wild yams—deep as eight feet—to fill our stomachs. Then fever came for Jude, my sister, who had cared for baby Nomfue. When I ran for help, she was already gone.

We buried her across the creek, with one pig and borrowed rice. Even grief had to be shared.

Reflection:
In the quiet after death, the earth still holds us. Digging for yams, I learned that life and loss both come from the same soil.

Chapter 8 — The Provider

1977

Every morning I carried my basket and digging tool. Some days I found nothing until sunset. Yet we never starved. There was always just enough.

Reflection:
I believe in a God who loves orphans. Not because I was taught to—but because, in the emptiest places, something always provided.

Chapter 9 — The Road to Mother
After months of not hearing from mother, Niam Hlob Vamteev brought news.
“Choj,” she said, “I met your mother. She’s living in zos Tiaj Nyujqus. If you miss her, you can go visit.”

The rice was weeded, and there was little work to do. I asked Grandma if we could go. She looked at me and said, “Go—see her, and see how she loves you.”

The next morning, Jude and I took Xeng Doua and Nomfue and began the long walk—three or four hours across hills and rivers. Along the way, I caught a small crayfish and gave it to Nomfue to carry. When we looked back, our father’s old opium field shimmered in the sunlight.

Tears came, and Jude and I sang softly:
“Ua licas nim tshav ntuj nrig es menyuam ntsuag tsis muaj niam tsis muaj txiv...”
(How bright the sun shines, yet we orphans—with no mother and no father—walk this road searching for them.) We cried until we saw snakes saw snakes slithering everywhere through the grass. Frightened, we screamed and ran uphill, until the ground leveled again near the edge of zos Tiaj Nyujqus. 

We didn’t know which house was our mother’s, but I recognized Aunt Tsav Txhiaj Muas’s home. We stopped there and asked, “Do you know where Nom Maiv Lis lives?” She pointed her finger and said, “Her house is over there.” 

We ran down the hill and came near the house. At the edge of the yard we stopped. I asked Jude to knock on the door, but she refused. I asked Xeng Doua, and he didn’t want to either. Finally, I got frustrated and tapped his head with my knuckle and he began to cry loudly. 

Inside, my mother heard his cry. She opened the door and saw us standing there—four children who had walked miles to find her. She let us in, and we stayed with her for about a week before returning home.

Epilogue — Do Not Separate Them

My father’s words became a map. They led us through famine, through war, through shame, through love. To stay together was not easy—but it was everything.

And though I barely remember his face, I carry his footsteps in my heart.

Book Summary

Do Not Separate Them is a 20,000‑word condensed memoir of a boy’s journey through loss and war in Laos (1970–1977). After his father dies building an opium‑field cabin, his family endures hunger, displacement, and orphanhood under a grandmother’s care. Told through eight short chapters, each paired with reflection, the story explores resilience, compassion, and faith in a world without certainty.

It is not only the story of one family—but of all who have learned that even in the hardest soil, love can take root.
