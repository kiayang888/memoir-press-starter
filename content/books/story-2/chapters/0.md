## Epilogue — The Father I Remember

There are moments in life that stay inside you forever—the sound of your father’s footsteps, the smell of rain on the mountain, the voice of your grandmother telling stories by the fire. These memories have never left me. They became the heartbeat that guided me through loss, war, and change.

When I began writing this story, I wanted to remember my father—not just the way he looked, but the way he lived. He was a quiet man, steady and kind. He did not have to raise his voice to be strong. His strength came from love. In every season of my life, I have tried to walk in his footsteps.

I also wrote this for the children who once were orphans like us. The ones who lost everything but still found a way to live. The ones who learned that love, even when broken, still gives life. I want them to know that being an orphan does not mean being forgotten. It means you have seen the world at its hardest and still found the courage to love.

When I think back to that day—the one when my father carried my brother on his back, even as his body was failing—I realize now what he left us. He didn’t leave land or riches. He left a message that has carried us through every hardship:
“Take care of the children. Do not separate them.”

Those words became our foundation.
Through hunger, loss, and exile, we stayed together.
Through my grandmother’s strength and the Lord’s mercy, we found our way.

Today, I look at my children and grandchildren, and I see my father’s love still living in them. The story did not end in the mountains of Laos—it continues wherever we walk, wherever we build, and wherever we remember.

This book is my way of keeping his promise alive.
A father’s love never dies—it becomes the roots that hold every generation together.
